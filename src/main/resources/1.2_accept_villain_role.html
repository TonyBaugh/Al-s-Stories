    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Accept the Role of the Villain</div>

        <p>The tension is <span class="warning">electric</span>, thick with something raw, something just shy of terror. It coils around the gathered crowd like an unseen force, pressing against their ribs, tightening around their throats. Some avert their eyes. Others hold their breath.</p>

        <p>They are waiting.</p>

        <p>You let the silence stretch, watching the way it twists them, the way uncertainty becomes something <span class="warning">sharp and fragile</span>. Then, you step forward.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“You already know what I am,”</p> you say, voice measured, deliberate. <p class="dialogue">“And you know what happens to those who stand against me.”</p>

        <p>A ripple moves through them—<span class="fade">a breath caught in a hundred lungs</span>. Some flinch, shrinking into themselves. Others go still, their hands shifting toward weapons not yet drawn. And then there are those whose eyes burn with something else entirely.</p>

        <p>Not fear. Not reverence. <span class="rift-energy">Something harder.</span></p>

        <p>A woman stands among them, unyielding, a dagger resting easily in her grip. The <span class="rift-energy">violet glow</span> at her fingertips flickers but does not wane. Her gaze is steady.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“This is a mistake,”</p> she murmurs, but her voice carries through the space like a blade. <p class="dialogue">“We can’t let it happen again.”</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Again.</span></p>

        <p>The word strikes you like a sudden chill. It curls around you, lingers in the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s hum</span>, echoes through the places in your mind that are still empty.</p>

        <p>Behind her, figures shift in the crowd. A group of armed soldiers step forward, their expressions schooled into blank submission. Their leader meets your gaze without hesitation, his posture rigid with the weight of expectation.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“Your command?”</p>

        <p>It is not truly a question.</p>

        <p>You see it in their faces—their fear, their loyalty, their hunger for something greater. Power is not about taking—it is about being given. And in this moment, <span class="rift-energy">they are offering themselves to you</span>.</p>

        <p>But power is not absolute. <span class="fade">Not all kneel so easily.</span></p>

        <p>A stir in the crowd. Another figure is dragged forward, chains clanking against the broken ground. An old adversary—someone who once stood against you. Someone who failed. Their face is weary, lined with battles lost, but there is no hatred in their expression.</p>

        <p>Only <span class="fade">quiet knowing.</span></p>

        <p>They meet your gaze, and for the first time, someone looks at you not with fear, not with reverence, but with <span class="warning">pity</span>.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“We’ve done this before,”</p> they whisper. <p class="dialogue">“You don’t have to do it again.”</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift pulses</span> behind you, a slow and rhythmic beat, like a second heart. Like laughter. Like something waiting to be remembered.</p>

        <p>A sharp pull at the edges of your mind—<span class="rift-energy">a sensation not unlike déjà vu</span>. Have you stood here before? Have you spoken these words, given these commands, watched these same choices unfold?</p>

        <p>If you choose war, <span class="warning">will it end the same way?</span></p>

        <p>If you seize the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s power</span>, will you finally control what once controlled you?</p>

        <p>If you destroy it… <span class="rift-energy">what happens then?</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift hums</span> in anticipation.</p>

        <p>And the world waits for your decision.</p>
