    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">A Sudden, Overwhelming Urge – Leave</div>

        <p>A weight presses against your chest—<span class="fade">expectation, duty, something nameless</span>. But instinct whispers louder.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">Leave.</span></p>

        <p>This place, these people, their words—<span class="fade">they mean nothing</span>. They feel like they should mean something, but they don’t. Not to you.</p>

        <p>You turn. You don’t wait for protests, for explanations, for pleading voices to try and anchor you here. <span class="warning">You move.</span></p>

        <p>The moment your foot touches the ground, something shifts.</p>

        <p>A ripple moves through the air, <span class="rift-energy">subtle yet undeniable</span>, as if the very fabric of this world is reacting to your decision. The murmurs behind you fade into static, blending into the distant hum of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s presence</span>. You do not look back.</p>

        <p>You do not dare.</p>

        <p>The landscape before you stretches in ways that do not make sense. A path—<span class="fade">was it always there?</span>—winds ahead, vanishing into a horizon that bends and distorts, refusing to remain still. The air is thick with something unseen, something <span class="warning">watching</span>.</p>

        <p>You keep walking.</p>

        <p>The wind shifts, carrying whispers—fragmented, overlapping, urgent. You cannot tell if they are calling you back or urging you forward.</p>

        <p>Then, <span class="rift-energy">they appear</span>.</p>

        <p>Figures step from the ruinous landscape, their cloaks <span class="fade">tattered with time</span>, their faces hidden beneath heavy hoods. They do not rush to stop you, nor do they attack. Their presence is both <span class="rift-energy">eerie</span> and <span class="fade">familiar</span>, as if you have seen them before… somewhere.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“You shouldn’t be here.”</p>

        <p>The voice belongs to one of them. Firm, but not hostile. <span class="fade">A warning</span>, not a command.</p>

        <p>As the group encircles you, a woman steps forward, her piercing <span class="rift-energy">silver eyes</span> gleaming beneath her hood. Something about her gaze feels ancient—not in age, but in knowledge.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“If you keep going, you’ll reach the Rift,”</p> she says. <p class="dialogue">“But reaching it and leaving are two very different things.”</p>

        <p>She studies you, searching for something—perhaps recognition, perhaps understanding—but you offer neither.</p>

        <p>After a moment, she tilts her head slightly, as though realizing something.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“…You don’t remember, do you?”</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift pulses</span>, deep and resonant. It is waiting. <span class="warning">Daring you to choose.</span></p>

        <p>Do you follow the wanderer deeper, trusting that they hold the answers you seek?</p>

        <p>Do you confront them, demanding to know what they know before taking another step?</p>

        <p>Or do you turn back, unwilling to risk what lies ahead?</p>

    </div>
