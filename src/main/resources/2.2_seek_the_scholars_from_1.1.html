    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Investigate the Rift’s Nature</div>

        <p>The war table is crowded with expectation. Maps are sprawled before you, the ink still fresh on battle plans that have been rewritten a hundred times over. The council’s voices press against you, layering over one another—strategy, supply lines, the inevitability of bloodshed. Their words swirl like <span class="fade">vultures over a carcass</span>.</p>

        <p>Your eyes trace the jagged lines drawn across the maps—boundaries shifting, territories lost and reclaimed, the slow, grinding erosion of a war that has outlived the memory of why it began.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">Something about this is wrong.</span></p>

        <p class="dialogue">“The Rift is not simply a weapon,”</p> you say at last, your voice calm, but weighted. <p class="dialogue">“It is something more. And we do not understand it.”</p>

        <p>Silence grips the chamber like a vice. Some of the council shift uneasily. Others glare, their hands twitching toward the blades at their sides.</p>

        <p>Ilvane exhales sharply, her stance unwavering. <span class="dialogue">“You are the chosen leader,”</span> she reminds you, her voice <span class="warning">flint against steel</span>. <span class="dialogue">“You must act.”</span></p>

        <p>You study her—her battle-worn armor, the hard lines of her face, the certainty in her gaze. She believes action is the only path forward. But action without understanding? That is what led them here in the first place.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“No,”</p> you murmur, stepping away from the table. <p class="dialogue">“Not yet.”</p></p>

        <p>The council does not follow as you turn, pushing open the heavy doors and descending into the fortress depths.</p>

        <p>The lower halls are <span class="fade">suffocatingly quiet</span>, the flickering glow of candlelight barely piercing the gloom. The air smells of parchment and dust, thick with the weight of forgotten words. You walk between towering shelves of crumbling tomes, past maps drawn by hands that turned to dust centuries ago.</p>

        <p>The scholars are here—<span class="fade">pale figures hunched over their work</span>, their fingers ink-stained, their eyes sunken from too many nights spent chasing truths the world above ignores. They murmur to one another in hushed tones, whispering of <span class="rift-energy">patterns in the Rift’s energy</span>, of <span class="warning">anomalies in time</span>, of something <span class="rift-energy">stirring beneath the surface of reality</span>.</p>

        <p>One of them looks up as you approach. His robes are faded, his hands trembling over a brittle scroll. Candlelight pools in the dark hollows of his face.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“You should not be here,”</p> he says, voice hoarse from disuse.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“I should,”</p> you counter, stepping closer. <p class="dialogue">“Tell me what the council does not.”</p></p>

        <p>The scholar hesitates, then exhales—a slow, rattling breath. He gestures toward a book laid open before him, its pages stained with ink that shifts as you try to read it, as if <span class="rift-energy">refusing to be understood</span>.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“The Rift does not give power,”</p> he murmurs. <p class="dialogue">“It takes. And it always takes more than it gives.”</p></p>

        <p>You feel his words settle in your bones, <span class="warning">cold and heavy as stone</span>. <p class="dialogue">“Then what does it want?”</p></p>

        <p>His fingers tighten around the parchment. The candle flames flicker—not from any draft, but as if the very air <span class="rift-energy">shudders</span> in response to your question.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“Perhaps,”</p> the scholar whispers, his voice barely audible over the growing <span class="rift-energy">hum</span> in your ears, <p class="dialogue">“you should ask it yourself.”</p></p>

        <p>And in the distance, beyond stone walls and broken battlements, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift pulses</span> once more—<span class="warning">deep and knowing</span>.</p>

        <p class="rift-energy">This time, it almost sounds like laughter.</p>
