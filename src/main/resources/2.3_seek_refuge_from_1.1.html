    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Can a Hero Abandon Their Cause?</div>

        <p>The council chambers press in around you—</p>

        <p>expectant faces, whispered reassurances,</p>

        <p>the weight of leadership settling onto your shoulders</p>

        <p>like an iron shroud.</p>

        <p>You can see it in their eyes.</p>

        <p>They do not need you to remember.</p>

        <p>They need you to be what they claim you were.</p>

        <p>But you cannot.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“I don’t trust you.”</p>

        <p>The words land like a blade driven into stone.</p>

        <p>The murmurs falter.</p>

        <p>Ilvane’s expression does not change,</p>

        <p>but her fingers tighten around the hilt of her sword.</p>

        <p>Others exchange uneasy glances,</p>

        <p>their confidence cracking like glass.</p>

        <p>An elder clears his throat,</p>

        <p>voice measured but laced with warning.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“The <span class="rift">Rift</span> warps memory,”</p>

        <p>he says carefully.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“Perhaps you’ve been gone too long.”</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">Gone.</p>

        <p>The word tugs at something deep within you—</p>

        <p>something just out of reach.</p>

        <p>It is not memory,</p>

        <p>but absence.</p>

        <p>A shape where something should be.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Before you can press for answers,</p>

        <p>the heavy doors burst open.</p>

        <p>A messenger stumbles inside, breathless,</p>

        <p>his cloak dusted with the red sands of the outer territories.</p>

        <p>He holds a scroll wrapped in black ribbon,</p>

        <p>his hands trembling as he extends it toward you.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“This came from the rebels,”</p>

        <p>he pants.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“They claim to know the truth.”</p>

        <p>A charged silence grips the room.</p>

        <p>The elders shift,</p>

        <p>their gazes darkening.</p>

        <p>The council does not move to stop you,</p>

        <p>but their disapproval is a physical thing,</p>

        <p>settling like storm clouds over the chamber.</p>

        <p>Your fingers brush against the seal,</p>

        <p>the wax crumbling at your touch.</p>

        <p>You unravel the parchment,</p>

        <p>eyes scanning the words scrawled in sharp, deliberate strokes.</p>

        <p>And then you freeze.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span>.</p>

        <p>The war.</p>

        <p>The purpose of all of this.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">It is nothing like what they told you.</p>

        <p>The very foundation of your so-called destiny</p>

        <p>may be a lie.</p>

    </div>
