    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Seek Refuge Away from Conflict</div>

        <p>The weight of their expectations clings to you, but you refuse to bear it.</p>

        <p>You are not the savior they crave, nor the villain they fear.</p>

        <p>Whatever you were before, it no longer defines you.</p>

        <p class="rift-fate">So, you leave.</p>

        <p>The settlement’s outskirts crumble beneath the weight of forgotten time.</p>

        <p>Rusted banners, tattered and wind-torn, hang from shattered walls.</p>

        <p>The voices behind you fade.</p>

        <p>Swallowed by the howling wind.</p>

        <p>Streets where children watch in silence.</p>

        <p>Eyes tracking your departure, but never calling you back.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">They understand.</p>

        <p class="rift-fate">You will not choose.</p>

        <p>The land beyond is a graveyard of forgotten wars.</p>

        <p>Ruined outposts rise like broken teeth from the earth, their stones cracked and blackened.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-shadow">Rift</span> looms on the horizon, its light casting impossible shapes against the darkening sky.</p>

        <p>Even here, you feel it—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Watching.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Waiting.</p>

        <p>A ruined chapel stands at the valley’s edge, half-swallowed by time.</p>

        <p>Its stained-glass windows are shattered.</p>

        <p>Its steeple, twisted by <span class="rift-shadow">Rift-born scars</span>.</p>

        <p>Yet, inside—</p>

        <p>The air is still.</p>

        <p>Quiet.</p>

        <p>For the first time since awakening—</p>

        <p class="rift-fate">You breathe.</p>

        <p>The quiet does not last.</p>

        <p>A whisper slithers through the broken walls, threading between shattered pews.</p>

        <p>It does not speak in words, but in meaning.</p>

        <p>An <span class="rift-shadow">invitation</span>.</p>

        <p>A <span class="rift-shadow">promise</span> of understanding.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">The Rift hums.</p>

        <p>Then—</p>

        <p>Movement.</p>

        <p>A shadow shifts between the ruined pillars.</p>

        <p>Not an enemy.</p>

        <p>Not a beast.</p>

        <p>Something else.</p>

        <p>A figure cloaked in tattered robes.</p>

        <p>Their presence neither threatening nor welcoming.</p>

        <p>They watch you from the dim light filtering through fractured stone.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“Running will not save you,”</p> they murmur. <p class="dialogue">“It never has.”</p>

        <p>You stiffen.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">The Rift pulses.</p>

        <p>The whispering wind carries their words deeper into your bones.</p>
