    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Attempt to Subjugate the Rift’s Power</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> looms before you—an abyss of writhing color, a wound in the skin of reality that refuses to heal.</p>

        <p>Where others see <span class="rift-warning">chaos</span>, an unknowable force beyond mortal comprehension, you see something else.</p>

        <p>You see <span class="rift-energy">potential</span>.</p>

        <p>From the blackened spires of your stronghold, you overlook the <span class="rift-mystery">shifting landscape</span>. Below, your army gathers, their ranks stretching beyond the limits of sight. Their armor catches the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s eerie glow</span>, their weapons thrumming with the quiet promise of war.</p>

        <p>But war alone is not enough.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-warning">council chambers</span> echo with debate, voices clashing like drawn steel.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“We cannot control something that does not obey the rules of existence.”</p>

        <p>The speaker’s knuckles turn white against the table, the weight of their words pressing into the air like a warning.</p>

        <p>You let the silence stretch before speaking.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“That is because they lacked the will.”</p>

        <p>The room stills.</p>

        <p>At the far edge of the chamber, Ilvane watches, her expression unreadable beneath the flickering torchlight. She does not object. Perhaps she understands. Perhaps she is waiting to see whether you will <span class="rift-warning">succeed</span>—or be <span class="rift-warning">consumed</span>.</p>

        <p>You turn away from the council, stepping toward the massive iron doors that lead to the <span class="rift-energy">inner sanctum</span>. The air changes as you enter—a quiet reverence settling over the scholars and sorcerers who work tirelessly in the cathedral of ambition and defiance.</p>

        <p>Runes flicker across the walls, their energy unstable, volatile.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Rift-touched artifacts</span> rest upon stone pedestals, shifting as if caught between two realities.</p>

        <p>You step toward the largest containment field—a sphere of <span class="rift-energy">pure Rift energy</span>, crackling within a dark metal framework.</p>

        <p>It does not flicker. It does not shift.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It watches.</span></p>

        <p>A scholar steps forward, her violet robes draped over weary shoulders. There is awe in her voice.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"The Rift… it does not resist us,"</p> she whispers. <p class="dialogue">"It… listens."</p>

        <p>The energy writhes, responding to your presence, tendrils of light curling toward you as if reaching for <span class="rift-warning">recognition</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It knows you.</span></p>

        <p>Your breath hitches.</p>

        <p>It is not merely a force.</p>

        <p>It is not merely a wound.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It is aware.</span></p>

        <p>And it is <span class="rift-warning">waiting</span>.</p>

    </div>
