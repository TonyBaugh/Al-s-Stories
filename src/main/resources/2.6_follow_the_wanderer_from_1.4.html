    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">They Seem to Recognize You. Should You Trust Them?</div>

        <p>The settlement fades behind you, swallowed by the <span class="rift-shadow">Rift’s</span> unnatural horizon.</p>

        <p>The people you left behind—</p>

        <p>Their prayers, their warnings, their fear—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">They no longer matter.</p>

        <p>The only thing that does is the figure walking ahead of you—</p>

        <p>Silent.</p>

        <p>Sure-footed.</p>

        <p>Unburdened by the weight of expectation that clings to your every step.</p>

        <p>The wanderer does not speak.</p>

        <p>They do not check if you follow.</p>

        <p class="rift-mystery">They already know you will.</p>

        <p>There is no true path beneath your feet.</p>

        <p>The land shifts—</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">Slow.</p>

        <p>Unsettling.</p>

        <p>As if the ground itself is unsure whether it should be stone, sand, or something far older.</p>

        <p>You step forward—</p>

        <p>For a brief moment, it is like walking through water—</p>

        <p>Then solid earth returns beneath your boots.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">But now it is cracked.</p>

        <p>Glowing veins of violet energy pulse beneath the surface.</p>

        <p>The sky darkens.</p>

        <p>Not with the coming of night—</p>

        <p>But with something else.</p>

        <p class="rift-mystery">Something vast.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">Something remembering.</p>

        <p>The stars do not remain where they should.</p>

        <p>They flicker in and out, shifting.</p>

        <p>Constellations forming and unforming—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Like the sky itself is rewriting what it once knew.</p>

        <p>The ruins that rise around you are not broken by time.</p>

        <p>They are fractured—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Suspended between collapse and rebuilding.</p>

        <p>Some pillars stand strong, then vanish.</p>

        <p>Others crumble, then reform—</p>

        <p>As if their destruction has not yet decided whether it should be real.</p>

        <p>The carvings on the walls flicker—</p>

        <p>Not like fading paint,</p>

        <p>But like words being rewritten—</p>

        <p class="rift-mystery">History shifting as you look at it.</p>

        <p>At last, the wanderer speaks.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"This world has already been decided,"</p> they say.  

        <p class="dialogue">"And yet, you walk outside of its design."</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Do you know why?"</p>

        <p>The question settles into you—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">A stone dropped into still water.</p>

        <p>You do not answer.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you do not know.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you do not want to.</p>

        <p>The path narrows.</p>

        <p>A clearing stretches ahead—</p>

        <p>Three roads split before you.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-shadow">Rift</span> looms beyond, casting the world in hues of shifting violet and cold silver.</p>

        <p>The air itself feels thinner—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Like whatever boundary separates this reality from something else is stretched—</p>

        <p>Moments from tearing.</p>

        <p>The wanderer finally stops.</p>

        <p>They turn toward you for the first time.</p>

        <p>Their face is unreadable.</p>

        <p>But their eyes—</p>

        <p class="rift-mystery">They do not question.</p>

        <p>They do not plead.</p>

        <p>They do not hope.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">They know.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You came seeking answers."</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Choose wisely."</p>
