    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">=== LEAD THE WAR TO THE RIFT ===</div>

        <p class="dialogue">"Do you fight for power, or for survival?"</p>

        <p>A tremor rumbles beneath your feet, deeper than shifting earth—this is not the ground shaking. It is something deeper. <span class="rift-intensified">Something unraveling.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> flares, its radiance surging outward in a violent, soundless scream, warping the sky into a shifting tapestry of <span class="highlight">gold</span>, <span class="rift-intensified">violet</span>, and <span class="warning">black.</span> The world bends around it, the battlefield caught in its pull like a thread unraveling from the fabric of reality.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You march toward victory."</p> 

        <p>The figure before you—the impossible, Rift-forged being—does not attack. They watch, the glow of the Rift reflected in the abyss of their gaze. Their tone is not mocking. Not cruel. It is simply... certain.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"But victory is a word shaped by the rules of men. The <span class="rift-intensified">Rift</span> does not follow those rules."</p>

        <p>Before you can speak, reality <span class="warning">fractures.</span></p>

        <p>A pulse surges outward from the Rift, and in its wake—<span class="warning">nothing.</span> Whole sections of your army simply cease to exist. Not burned, not swallowed. <span class="fade">Gone.</span> Their presence erased so cleanly that for an instant, your mind stutters, struggling to recall if they had ever been there at all.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"We’re losing them."</p>

        <p>And then, through the Rift’s surging glow, <span class="rift-intensified">they</span> step forward.</p>

        <p>A second army—silent, intact—emerges from the warping light.</p>

        <p>Their armor is layered with metal and something else, something alive, shifting like liquid shadow. Their weapons do not gleam with steel, but hum with something deeper, something raw, something woven from the <span class="rift-intensified">Rift</span> itself.</p>

        <p>At their head, the Riftborn leader.</p>

        <p>Their armor is etched with impossible sigils, pulsing in eerie synchronization with the Rift. Their presence does not distort—it stabilizes, commanding both respect and unease.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You do not understand what you are walking into."</p>

        <p>Their voice is even, cutting through the heavy air.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"The <span class="rift-intensified">Rift</span> is not something to fear. It is something to wield."</p>

        <p>A chill settles into your bones.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> pulses, <span class="warning">hungry</span>, patient, waiting.</p>
