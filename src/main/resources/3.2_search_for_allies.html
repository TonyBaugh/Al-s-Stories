    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Are You Willing to Risk Unknown Forces for Help?</div>

        <p>The figure stands motionless,</p>

        <p>their form wavering as though barely tethered to reality.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> pulses behind them,</p>

        <p>its warping energy casting jagged, twisting shadows across the battlefield.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You march toward a war you do not understand,"</p>

        <p>they repeat, their voice stretching across time itself.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"And yet you still believe in victory."</p>

        <p>A chill curls around your spine.</p>

        <p>The soldiers behind you murmur in hushed voices, shifting uneasily.</p>

        <p>Ilvane tightens her grip on her sword,</p>

        <p>her breath steady but sharp,</p>

        <p>like she is forcing herself not to react.</p>

        <p>But you?</p>

        <p>You step forward.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“If we do not understand,”</p>

        <p>you say, voice firm,</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“then teach me.”</p>

        <p>The figure tilts their head slightly,</p>

        <p>the <span class="rift">Rift’s</span> glow catching the edges of their shifting armor.</p>

        <p>Then, they turn without a word</p>

        <p>and begin to walk—</p>

        <p>no, drift—</p>

        <p>back toward the <span class="rift">Rift’s</span> horizon.</p>

        <p>The moment you follow,</p>

        <p>the world around you twists.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">The battlefield vanishes.</p>

        <p>The air grows heavy, thick with something beyond breath—</p>

        <p>something vast, something watching.</p>

        <p>The sky overhead fractures like shattered glass,</p>

        <p>stars peeking through the splintered void where they should not be.</p>

        <p>A sprawling structure emerges before you,</p>

        <p>formed from Riftstone—</p>

        <p>its walls shimmer between ancient, crumbling ruins</p>

        <p>and something newly built,</p>

        <p>something shifting between states of existence.</p>

        <p class="rift-pulse">The Archive of the Riftborn.</p>

        <p>A place forgotten by time.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps erased from it.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Riftborn</span> Scholars move like ghosts through its halls,</p>

        <p>their robes woven with threads of shifting light,</p>

        <p>their faces concealed beneath hoods that seem to fold inward, endless.</p>

        <p>They do not speak immediately,</p>

        <p>but they acknowledge your presence,</p>

        <p>a silent recognition of something inevitable.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You do not want power,"</p>

        <p>one scholar finally murmurs,</p>

        <p>their voice echoing softly in the vast silence.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You want to know."</p>

        <p>They lead you deeper.</p>

        <p>Towering shelves stretch beyond sight,</p>

        <p>books bound in dark leather inscribed with symbols</p>

        <p>that twist the longer you stare at them.</p>

        <p>Scrolls float between hands that never touch them,</p>

        <p>their words flickering between languages long dead</p>

        <p>and ones yet to be spoken.</p>

        <p>One of the scholars halts before a great obsidian pedestal.</p>

        <p>A tome rests upon it, bound not in paper,</p>

        <p>but in something that ripples like liquid void.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"This was not written,"</p>

        <p>the scholar whispers, reverence lacing their voice.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"It was remembered."</p>

        <p>Your fingers brush the cover,</p>

        <p>and the <span class="rift">Rift</span> hums.</p>

        <p>The moment you open the tome,</p>

        <p>the world shifts.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">The First Revelation.</p>

        <p>A time before war.</p>

        <p>Before suffering.</p>

        <p>A civilization that did not fear the <span class="rift">Rift</span>,</p>

        <p>but understood it.</p>

        <p>Thrived within it.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">The First Disappearance.</p>

        <p>An age swallowed in silence.</p>

        <p>A history rewritten, not by time,</p>

        <p>but by design.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">The Final Act.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> was never an accident.</p>

        <p>It was never a wound.</p>

        <p>It was a choice.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">"You were not meant to see this."</p>

        <p>The scholar at your side exhales shakily.</p>

        <p>Their hands tremble as they close the book,</p>

        <p>their hood tilting slightly toward you.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"The <span class="rift">Rift</span> is not merely a fracture in reality,"</p>

        <p>they say.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"It is a door.</p>

        <p>And someone—</p>

        <p>something—</p>

        <p>has been deciding what remains on either side."</p>

        <p>Beneath your feet, the ground shudders.</p>

        <p>The realization settles into your bones,</p>

        <p>deeper than fear.</p>

        <p>This is not lost history.</p>

        <p>This is erased history.</p>

        <p>And if it was erased once…</p>

        <p>it can be erased again.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> hums—</p>

        <p>not in warning,</p>

        <p>but in acknowledgment.</p>

        <p>It knows you see it now.</p>

        <p>And now,</p>

        <p>it waits for your next move.</p>
