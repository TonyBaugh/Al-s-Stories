    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">If It Is a Wound in Reality, Can It Be Closed?</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> looms ahead,</p>

        <p>a storm of impossible hues—</p>

        <p>violet folding into gold,</p>

        <p>obsidian streaked with pulses of searing white.</p>

        <p>Its presence is overwhelming,</p>

        <p>its pulse thrumming through the ground,</p>

        <p>through your bones,</p>

        <p>through the space behind your eyes.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">It is alive.</p>

        <p>And it is waiting.</p>

        <p>Behind you,</p>

        <p>your path is already fading.</p>

        <p>Whether you marched here as a warrior,</p>

        <p>sought knowledge as a scholar,</p>

        <p>or fled to escape the war that raged beyond its horizon,</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">none of it matters now.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">All roads lead to the <span class="rift">Rift</span>.</p>

        <p>The council’s voices echo in your memory—</p>

        <p>warnings, desperate prayers,</p>

        <p>half-formed theories of what the <span class="rift">Rift</span> is</p>

        <p>and what it can become.</p>

        <p>No one has ever sealed it before.</p>

        <p>No one has ever dared.</p>

        <p>But they were not you.</p>

        <p>Scholars stand at the edge of the anomaly,</p>

        <p>their hands moving feverishly over arcane symbols</p>

        <p>etched into the shattered remains of the land.</p>

        <p>They draw sigils in luminous ink,</p>

        <p>etch equations into stone</p>

        <p>that no longer obeys physics.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“The <span class="rift">Rift</span> is not merely a tear in reality,”</p>

        <p>one of them murmurs,</p>

        <p>their voice hoarse from sleepless nights.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“It is woven through everything.</p>

        <p>If we close it,</p>

        <p>we close something far greater than we understand.”</p>

        <p>You press a hand against the shifting air near the Rift’s core.</p>

        <p>It is warm.</p>

        <p>Not like fire,</p>

        <p>not like flesh.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">Like something vast.</p>

        <p>Something aware.</p>

        <p>It pushes back against you.</p>

        <p>Slow at first,</p>

        <p>then with more force.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">It does not want to be sealed.</p>

        <p>A deep vibration rattles through the earth.</p>

        <p>The symbols glow brighter,</p>

        <p>lines of energy snapping like taut strings drawn too tight.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> is fighting back.</p>

        <p>And then—</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">a voice.</p>

        <p>It does not come from the scholars.</p>

        <p>It does not come from your soldiers.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“You cannot close what was never meant to be open.”</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> flickers,</p>

        <p>its swirling mass of light distorting</p>

        <p>into something more familiar,</p>

        <p>more human—</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">a silhouette,</p>

        <p>just at the edge of understanding.</p>

        <p>Their form is indistinct,</p>

        <p>shifting with the <span class="rift">Rift’s</span> ever-changing pulse.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“Do you even know what you are trying to destroy?”</p>

        <p>The ground beneath you fractures,</p>

        <p>and suddenly,</p>

        <p>sealing the <span class="rift">Rift</span> no longer feels</p>

        <p>like an act of salvation.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">It feels like an execution.</p>
