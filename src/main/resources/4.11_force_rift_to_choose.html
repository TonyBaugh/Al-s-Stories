    <div class="story-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has been pulling at you since the beginning. Whispering. Beckoning. But now, as you stand at the threshold of its ever-shifting abyss, you do something no one has dared before.</p>

        <p>You do not resist it.</p>
        <p>You do not accept it.</p>
        <p>You do not reject it.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis">You let it decide.</span></p>

        <p>The moment you surrender your will to the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>—not as prey, not as conqueror, but as an equal—the world shudders. The weight of reality buckles, the ground beneath you fracturing into swirling threads of violet and obsidian. The air trembles with an unnatural stillness, as if the very laws of existence hesitate, unsure of how to proceed.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses—once, twice—then slows, as if considering.</p>

        <p>For the first time, it does not lash out. It does not consume. It does not pull you into its depths. It <span class="emphasis">watches</span>.</p>

        <p>And then, it <span class="emphasis">reaches</span>.</p>

        <p>Your mind is flooded with sensation—not words, not images, but possibilities. Futures unravel and reweave themselves in rapid succession. A thousand versions of yourself flicker through your vision—some standing as rulers, some kneeling as sacrifices, some dissolving into the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> itself, becoming something other.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis">It has always been like this.</span></p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">It has never been like this.</span></p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">You have always been here.</span></p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">You were never meant to be here.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is showing you everything. Every iteration. Every mistake. Every moment of choice and consequence, folded atop one another like the pages of a book too heavy to read in one lifetime.</p>

        <p>And now, it turns the final page.</p>

        <p>You feel it shift, settling upon a path that was always waiting, always watching, always shaping itself in response to you.</p>

        <p>A presence brushes against your thoughts—immense, unfathomable. Not cruel, not kind. Simply aware.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-voice">You are not in control anymore.</span></p>
        <p><span class="rift-voice">You never were.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> decides.</p>

        <p>A final pulse erupts outward—not of destruction, not of chaos, but of understanding. You are left with a choice that is not yours to make alone. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has spoken. It has chosen for you.</p>

        <p>It offers two paths—both endings to this story, both inevitable in their own way.</p>

        <p>One is an ending of <span class="rift-energy">sacrifice</span>. A way to restore what has been broken, but at the cost of yourself. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not grant mercy, but it understands necessity. To become part of it is to hold reality together—to give yourself so that others may live.</p>

        <p>The other is an ending beyond endings. A path beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> itself. To step past the boundary of existence, to leave behind everything and move into the unknown. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has chosen you for this, for something greater. But what lies beyond? Even it does not know.</p>
