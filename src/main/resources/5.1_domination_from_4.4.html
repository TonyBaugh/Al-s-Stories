    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> bends at your command, no longer a churning abyss of chaos but an extension of your will. Its pulsing waves of violet and gold spiral in perfect synchrony, wrapping around your form like threads weaving the fabric of a new reality. The moment you step forward, the very air trembles—not in protest, but in reverence.</p>

        <p>The world stands still.</p>

        <p>The armies that once clashed in desperate defiance fall silent. Some collapse to their knees, their weapons slipping from numb fingers as understanding takes hold. Others stare in horror, grasping at whatever scraps of resistance they can muster. You see it in their eyes—the slow, sinking realization that nothing can oppose you now.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-warning">Hope is a fragile thing.</span></p>

        <p>With a breath, you raise your hand.</p>

        <p>And the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> obeys.</p>

        <p>A pulse surges outward, a wave of energy so absolute that the landscape shifts beneath its wake. The sky fractures, swirling in impossible hues. The ground quakes, reshaping itself into new foundations. Ruins that have stood for centuries rise anew, reforged in the image of a world rewritten. The laws of nature—of time, space, even death—bend beneath the weight of your will.</p>

        <p>The Rift-born warriors do not hesitate. They kneel before you, their violet-lit eyes flickering with understanding. They knew this would happen. They have been waiting for it.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are no longer mortal.</span></p>
        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are no longer a ruler bound by the limitations of a single existence.</span></p>
        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are the Rift itself, and the world has only one choice—to follow.</span></p>

        <p>A thousand possibilities unfurl before you, as limitless as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> depths.</p>

        <p>You could shape a golden age, lifting civilization beyond war, beyond suffering. Rewrite history, purge weakness, forge perfection.</p>

        <p>Or you could cast judgment, reshaping reality as a god might sculpt clay, bending existence to your whim without mercy, without remorse.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps…</p>

        <p>You will not stop here.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses, not with hunger, not with chaos, but with endless potential. It has always been a force beyond human understanding, beyond mortal reach. But now, you are part of it.</p>

        <p>And beyond this world, there are others.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-warning">What lies beyond the Rift’s reach?</span></p>
        <p><span class="rift-warning">What lies beyond you?</span></p>

        <p>The choice is no longer the world’s to make.</p>
        <p>It belongs only to you.</p>

        <p>And with a final step, you leave behind the echoes of what was… and shape the dawn of what will be.</p>

        <p>For in the end, <span class="rift-energy">all of existence will bow to you.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> no longer threatens to consume you, nor does it stand beyond your control. <span class="rift-command">It is yours</span>—a force of pure potential, bending to your command.</p>
        
        <p>You are no longer bound by the constraints of mortality, of kingdoms, of history. You are the master of <span class="rift-command">reality itself</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Some will call you a <span class="rift-warning">savior</span>. Others, a <span class="rift-warning">tyrant</span>.</p>
        
        <p>But their words no longer matter.</p>
        
        <p>You alone dictate the future. You alone decide what reality will become.</p>
        
        <p><span class="rift-command">And nothing—nothing—can oppose you.</span></p>

    <div class="player-reflection">What This Means for the Player</div>
    <div class="summary-content">
        <p>You have fully embraced the Rift, not as its servant, but as its **master**.</p>
        
        <p>The **world no longer acts upon you—you act upon it**.</p>
        
        <p>Unlike the **Restoration Endings**, which seek balance, or the **Oblivion Endings**, which erase all, this is the path of **absolute control**.</p>
        
        <p>You **are** the Rift now, and the world kneels before you.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-warning">But in your dominion, one question lingers...</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-warning">You have conquered the Rift. You have conquered fate.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-warning">What remains to challenge you?</span></p>
