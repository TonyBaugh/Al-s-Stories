        <div class="ending-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not resist as you step forward. It does not fight. It does not yield. It simply becomes.</p>

            <p>And so do you.</p>

            <p>The pulsing colors of its swirling mass bend at your command, folding in on themselves, shifting in ways they never have before. The fractured shadows of those who came before—those who failed—shudder as your will takes form. Their hollow, echoing remnants scatter like dust caught in the wake of something greater.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are no mere traveler. You are no sacrifice. You are no consequence of fate.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are the Rift’s will made manifest.</span></p>

            <p>The shifting landscapes tremble, no longer wild, no longer untamed chaos. The fractures in reality, once open wounds upon existence, begin to mend—not in defiance of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> nature, but as an extension of your own. The world does not break under your grasp; it is <span class="emphasis">remade</span>.</p>

            <p>Shapes take form beneath your fingertips—mountains that rise, rivers that bend, skies that darken or brighten at a mere thought. The very laws of existence tremble at the presence of something new.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You.</span></p>

            <p>The first Riftborn Master.</p>

            <p>Through the haze of reforming existence, you feel the world beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> struggle to grasp what has occurred. Armies poised for war freeze in place, their banners wilting under skies that no longer obey the passage of time. Scholars who sought to unravel the Rift’s secrets now fall silent, their ink bleeding across pages of parchment that shift even as they write. Those who once called you ally, enemy, savior, destroyer—all are forced to reckon with the truth.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are beyond their reckoning.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> no longer devours—it <span class="emphasis">obeys</span>.</p>

            <p>A whisper drifts through the shifting void. Not from the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>. Not from the remnants of those who failed before.</p>

            <p>From something greater. Something deeper.</p>

            <p>It asks a question—not in words, but in the very fabric of reality itself.</p>

            <p><span class="emphasis">What will you do with this power?</span></p>

            <p>The world is yours to shape.</p>

            <p>Do you bring order to the chaos, forge a utopia beyond the comprehension of those who once struggled for meaning? Do you create a new dominion, one where none can challenge your will, where the Rift’s power serves no one but you? Or do you tear existence apart and rebuild it in a new vision, one that reshapes all things—past, present, and future—into something entirely unknown?</p>

            <p>The answer does not come in words. It does not need to.</p>

            <p>You close your eyes and decide.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift bends.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">And the world follows.</span></p>

        <div class="summary-title">Summary – Dominion Unchained</div>
        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>This is the Domination Ending—the ultimate assertion of control over the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, reality, and everything that once dictated fate. Unlike other endings where the Rift is destroyed, escaped, or transcended, this path establishes the player as something beyond mortal comprehension: a shaper of reality itself.</p>

            <p>This is not a story of balance or escape; it is a story of power—<span class="rift-energy">your</span> power—and how you choose to wield it.</p>

            <p>Rather than being consumed by the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, you become the first being to truly command it. The world no longer struggles against chaos, nor does it remain shackled to the old ways. It bends to your will, and only you decide what comes next.</p>

            <p>But power without limits raises a final question—do you rule with order, reshape existence into something unrecognizable, or dismantle the world entirely and build something new? The story does not answer for you.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You decide.</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>You have become the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, transcending the mortal conflicts and power struggles of the world.</li>
                <li>Your choices are now absolute—you dictate the future, whether through order, dominion, or creation.</li>
                <li>Unlike other endings, there is no higher force above you, no truth left to uncover. <span class="rift-energy">You are the final truth.</span></li>
                <li>This is an ending of immense power and responsibility—whether you bring peace, control, or destruction is left open.</li>
