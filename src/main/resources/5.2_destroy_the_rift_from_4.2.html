    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">The Rift's End</div>

        <p>You stand at the threshold of <span class="rift-danger">oblivion</span>, the <span class="rift-pulse">Rift’s energy</span> writhing around you like a living thing—furious, desperate, unwilling to be unmade.</p>

        <p>It pulses erratically, a chaotic storm of <span class="rift-pulse">violet</span> and <span class="rift-danger">obsidian</span> light, its tendrils reaching, grasping, as though trying to pull you into its endless depths.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-explosion">But you refuse.</span></p>

        <p>Your hands tremble from the weight of power surging through you, from the sheer force of what you are about to do. The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> has haunted existence for too long, whispering through history, bending fate to its unknowable will.</p>

        <p class="rift-danger"><strong>No more.</strong></p>

        <p>The ground beneath you fractures, veins of pale <span class="final-blow">gold</span> light seeping through the cracks, as if the very foundation of the world is resisting your choice. It knows. The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> knows.</p>

        <p>A thunderous pulse erupts from its core, a desperate final act. <span class="rift-danger">Crimson fire</span> and <span class="rift-pulse">silver storms</span> rip through the air, the sky splitting as black lightning slashes across it.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-echo">voices of the lost</span> surge forth, hundreds, thousands, their echoes entangled in the maelstrom.</p>

        <p class="rift-echo">Some plead.</p>
        <p class="rift-echo">Some curse.</p>
        <p class="rift-echo">Some scream.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-danger"><strong>But none of them stop you.</strong></span></p>

        <p class="final-blow">With a final breath, you strike.</p>

        <p class="rift-explosion">The explosion is blinding.</p>

        <p>A clash of <span class="final-blow">searing gold</span> and <span class="rift-explosion">midnight blue</span> as the <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> folds inward upon itself, an entire reality collapsing in an instant. Time stutters. The world shudders. The laws of existence crack like shattered glass.</p>

        <p class="rift-gone">And then—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-gone">Silence.</span></p>

        <p>The storm stills. The sky, once fractured and aflame, smooths into a deep, endless twilight.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> is gone.</p>

        <p>The place where it once pulsed is now a void—an absence so vast that for a moment, it feels as though something integral to reality itself has been <span class="rift-echo">cut away</span>. And yet, the weight that has loomed over existence for so long is lifted.</p>

        <p>The silence is not emptiness—it is <span class="final-blow">relief.</span></p>

        <p>For the first time in existence, the world belongs to itself again. The future is no longer written by forces unseen.</p>

        <p class="rift-explosion"><strong>It is free. You are free.</strong></p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="summary-title">Summary - Destruction</div>
        <div class="summary-content">
            The Rift is no more. In its final moments, it fought, it begged, but it could not stop you. You have erased it from existence, breaking its influence over the world.  
            But what was lost in its destruction? The Rift was not just an anomaly; it was woven into the fabric of reality. Without it, the world must redefine itself. And so must you.  
            Was the Rift merely chaos, or something vital? You stand in a world free for the first time in memory—but with that freedom comes uncertainty.  
            The Rift is gone. But did you truly win?
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="player-reflection">What This Means for the Player</div>
        <div class="summary-content">
            This is the ultimate act of defiance—the refusal to allow an unknown force to dictate fate any longer. It is a triumph, but one filled with lingering questions.  
            Was the Rift an invader, or something intrinsic to existence?  
            The world is free, but the cost of victory is not just the Rift’s annihilation—it is the loss of knowledge, of what might have been beyond it.  
            <strong>The Rift is gone. Now, what comes next?</strong>
