    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> shifts, the colors within its depths twisting in restless spirals—violet fractures against black, gold bleeding through like dying embers.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It knows what you are about to do.</span></p>

        <p>It does not resist.</p>

        <p>Your breath is steady as you lift your weapon, your hands trembling not from fear, but from the sheer weight of this moment. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has endured beyond the span of history, beyond the lifetimes of those who dared to name it. It has rewritten the fates of countless worlds, shaped and unmade civilizations, bent time itself to its unknowable will.</p>

        <p>And yet, here you stand.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">The last being who will ever challenge it.</span></p>

        <p>The sky fractures above, cracks of molten red splitting through a voidless abyss. The ground beneath you trembles, veins of golden light seeping through its fractures like the final heartbeat of a dying world.</p>

        <p>Ilvane’s voice cuts through the rising storm. <span class="dialogue">“If you do this… you might not survive.”</span></p>

        <p>You already know.</p>

        <p>A deep, resonant pulse ripples through the air—slow, measured. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> hum is no longer chaotic, no longer unstable. It is calm. As if waiting for something inevitable. As if it always knew this moment would come.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it did.</p>

        <p>You tighten your grip. No hesitation. No turning back.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You strike.</span></p>

        <p>Blinding light erupts, not as an explosion, but as a collapse—a force so absolute that space itself folds inward, devouring the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> from within. The warping light twists in upon itself, its core flickering like a dying star. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> screams, a soundless cry that tears through existence, shaking the very fabric of reality.</p>

        <p>The echoes of past voices—the warriors, the scholars, the <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span>, the ones who fought and fell before—shatter like glass, their whispers scattered to nothingness. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not lash out. It does not retaliate.</p>

        <p>It only ends.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">And so do you.</span></p>

        <p>The power surges through your veins, an unbearable force, a light too vast for mortal flesh to contain. Your body fractures, the golden energy seeping into your skin, your bones dissolving into something far beyond pain. You are not simply breaking.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are becoming part of the Rift’s final breath.</span></p>

        <p>The last thing you hear is Ilvane’s voice, distant, desperate, grieving.</p>

        <p>Then—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Silence.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is gone.</p>

        <p>The war is over.</p>

        <p>The world, once held hostage by its presence, breathes again. The sky smooths into a deep, endless twilight, the air no longer trembling beneath an unseen force. The weight that loomed over existence for countless ages lifts, leaving behind only quiet, only stillness.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">But you are not there to see it.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are nothing.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are everything.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are gone.</span></p>

        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has been destroyed—not by war, not by control, but by absolute annihilation. Its presence, its influence, its very existence has been erased. But the cost was final.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You do not walk away from this battle.</span> You do not claim victory. You do not witness the world freed from the Rift’s grasp.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Because you are gone.</span></p>
