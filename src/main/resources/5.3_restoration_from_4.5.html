    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses, expectant. It does not demand. It does not plead.</p>

        <p>It simply waits.</p>

        <p>You step forward, and the pressure of its presence deepens, folding around you like an ocean pressing in from all sides. The sky fractures above, shards of violet and obsidian bleeding into one another, the stars trembling at the edge of existence. The air hums—not as a force of destruction, but of transition. Of something ending so that something else might begin.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was never meant to be wielded. Never meant to be fought. It was never an accident, nor a wound.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It was a door.</span></p>

        <p>And now, it must be closed.</p>

        <p>Your body burns as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> energy surges toward you, latching onto every fragment of your existence. It is not violent. It is not cruel. It simply takes. The weight of it settles into your bones, seeping into your skin, your thoughts, your very presence.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are becoming something other.</span></p>

        <p>The ground quakes, the last remnants of reality pulling apart as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> struggles against its fate. It is vast. It is ancient. But even it is not beyond finality.</p>

        <p>Your form wavers, flickering between what you once were and what you are becoming. The whispers of those who came before, of those lost to the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> hunger, coil around you like the echoes of a dying star. They do not resist you. They do not mourn.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">They understand.</span></p>

        <p>And as you take your final step, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> contracts—its chaotic, writhing presence stilling, its pulse slowing, dimming, fading. Its form bends inward, drawn into itself, collapsing in perfect symmetry around you, its last vessel, its final keystone.</p>

        <p>And then, with a soundless breath—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It is sealed.</span></p>

        <p>The sky clears, the endless storm fading into twilight. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> presence no longer stains the horizon. The land, the ruins, the very fabric of reality trembles in quiet reverence.</p>

        <p>But you are not there to see it.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are gone.</span></p>

        <p>Not lost. Not consumed.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are the Rift now.</span></p>

        <p>And nothing will ever open it again.</p>

        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> no longer exists as an open wound upon reality. It has been sealed, stabilized—not by force, not by destruction, but by sacrifice. <span class="rift-energy">You have become its keystone</span>, ensuring that no one will ever wield its power again.</p>

            <p>The world breathes in relief.</p>

            <p>But it will never know what was lost to secure its peace.</p>

            <p>You have not died. You have not ascended. You have become something between. <span class="rift-energy">A guardian of the threshold</span>, a presence beyond time, neither forgotten nor remembered.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is at peace.</p>

            <p>And so are you.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer open, but it is not destroyed. Instead, it is locked away forever.</li>
            <li>Your sacrifice was complete—there is no throne, no legacy, no history written in your name.</li>
            <li>This is the most selfless ending possible: a quiet, permanent act to save the world from forces beyond its understanding.</li>
            <li>Unlike other endings, there is no final war, no power struggle, no cycle left to repeat. The world moves forward, unaware of how close it came to ruin.</li>
