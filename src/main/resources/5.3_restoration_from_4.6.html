        <div class="ending-content">
            <p>The moment your foot leaves solid ground, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> claims you.</p>

            <p>A pull—not violent, not forceful, but inevitable—wraps around you like a tide swallowing a lone figure in the vastness of the ocean. The world behind you blurs, its colors washing into streaks of pale gold and deep indigo. The sky fractures, not in destruction, but in acceptance.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are part of it now.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not consume. It does not destroy.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It weaves.</span></p>

            <p>Your body, your mind, your very existence is unraveled thread by thread, your form dissolving into something greater than flesh, greater than thought. But there is no fear. No agony. The pain of mortality, of limitation, of time itself fades into nothing, leaving only awareness—a deep, endless knowing.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You see it all.</span></p>

            <p>The moments that shaped this world. The countless hands that reached for the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> before you, some with reverence, others with greed. The cycle of war, of destruction, of desperate attempts to control what was never meant to be owned. And through it all, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> remained, unbroken, watching, waiting.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Waiting for this.</span></p>

            <p>The pulse of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> slows, its erratic, shifting energy stabilizing into something steady, something final. Its glow dims, no longer a wild beacon but a single, unwavering light. It is no longer an open wound. It is whole.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">And so are you.</span></p>

            <p>You are no longer separate from the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, no longer a traveler standing at its edge, no longer a seeker grasping for answers. <span class="rift-energy">You are the Rift’s answer.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are its keystone.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Its balance.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Its guardian.</span></p>

            <p>The world behind you does not collapse, nor does it change beyond recognition. The sky calms, the air stills. Time moves forward.</p>

            <p>And the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, for the first time in existence, does not hunger. It does not pulse with uncertainty. It does not call out.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It is at peace.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It has you.</span></p>

            <div class="summary-title">Summary – The Rift’s Keystone (Restoration Ending)</div>
            <div class="summary-content">
                <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer an anomaly, no longer an unknowable force lurking at the edge of reality. <span class="rift-energy">It is whole, stabilized by your presence.</span> You have given yourself to it, not as a sacrifice, but as a foundation—a keystone upon which the balance of existence now rests.</p>

                <p>The wars fought over the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, the battles waged in its name, the countless lives lost in pursuit of understanding—it all ends with you. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> will no longer devour. It will no longer be a force of chaos. It will endure, silent and unchanging, as it was always meant to be.</p>

                <p>And though the world will never know what became of you, it will know peace.</p>

                <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> no longer waits.</p>

                <p>Because you are there, watching over it, ensuring that no one will ever need to make this choice again.</p>

                <li>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer unstable or dangerous. It has been restored, and you are its foundation.</li>
                <li>Your fate is neither destruction nor conquest. Instead, you become something beyond mortal understanding—<span class="rift-energy">a force of balance.</span></li>
                <li>Unlike other restoration endings, this is not a sacrifice that erases you, but a transformation that makes you part of something eternal.</li>
                <li>The world moves forward, free from the chaos the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> once caused, but unaware of the force that keeps it at peace.</li>
