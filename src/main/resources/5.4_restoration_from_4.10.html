        <div class="ending-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> writhes, a maelstrom of violet, obsidian, and gold, spiraling upon itself in defiance. The world trembles beneath your feet, its very foundation protesting the impossible—that it could be denied, that it could be undone.</p>

            <p>But destruction is not your path.</p>

            <p>You do not seek to erase. You do not seek to command.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You seek to heal.</span></p>

            <p>You plant your feet, steadying yourself against the quaking earth. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> thrashes, its endless tendrils of energy clawing at the air, searching for something—anything—to pull apart, to devour, to continue existing. It does not understand mercy. It does not know restraint. It was never meant to be caged, never meant to be contained.</p>

            <p><span class="emphasis">But you understand.</span></p>

            <p>You raise your hands, not in violence, not in conquest, but in finality. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses as if it recognizes your intent, its form splintering, shrinking, folding inward, desperately trying to keep hold of what remains. The fractured sky groans, threads of gold and silver light splitting through the once-endless expanse of darkness.</p>

            <p>And then, with a single breath, <span class="emphasis">you push.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> shudders—not in pain, not in anger, but in acceptance. The energy that once wove through reality itself, distorting, reshaping, consuming—it begins to close.</p>

            <p>The great wound in existence, the thing that bent time, shattered fate, shaped wars and empires—it finally begins to heal.</p>

            <p>For the first time, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not fight.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It listens.</span></p>

            <p>Its tendrils coil inward, collapsing upon themselves, their once-violent hunger calming into something measured, contained, whole. The spiraling storm of its presence softens, no longer an open wound upon reality but a scar, faint and distant—a memory rather than a force.</p>

            <p>The air stills.</p>

            <p>The fractured land beneath your feet quiets, no longer shifting, no longer threatening to fall away into the abyss. The sky settles, its wounded gold streaks fading into the gentle hues of an approaching dawn.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not gone.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">But it is sealed.</span></p>

            <p>And so, the world breathes.</p>

            <p>A wind moves through the stillness, carrying with it the echoes of what was—a whisper of the past, of those who fought, of those who lost, of those who were consumed. But it is no longer a presence. No longer a force.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is finished.</p>

            <p>And for the first time in what feels like eternity, <span class="rift-energy">you are free.</span></p>

            <p>Not beyond the world. Not ruling over it. Not erased.</p>

            <p>Simply <span class="emphasis">free.</span></p>

            <p>You exhale, the weight on your shoulders lifting at last, and you turn away from what remains—knowing that it will never open again.</p>

            <p>You have not won by destroying.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You have won by restoring.</span></p>

            <p>And that, above all, is something the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> will never understand.</p>

            <p>But it no longer has to.</p>

            <div class="summary-content">
                <p>This is the <span class="rift-energy">Restoration Ending</span>, the path of healing rather than annihilation. Instead of erasing the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> entirely or seizing its power, you have done something no one else has—you have <span class="emphasis">closed</span> it.</p>

                <p>This is an ending of <span class="rift-energy">balance</span>, of finality without destruction, a victory that leaves behind a world that can move forward rather than one left in ruin.</p>

                <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> remains only as a scar upon existence, never again able to consume, to expand, to warp the fate of all things. The wars, the conflicts, the history tied to it—they do not vanish, but they are no longer controlled by forces beyond mortal reach.</p>

                <p><span class="rift-energy">It is over.</span></p>

                <p>And you have ensured that it will never return.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="rift-energy">The Rift</span> is permanently sealed. It no longer influences the world, no longer threatens to spiral out of control.</li>
                <li>You have not erased history. The scars remain, the world remembers, but it can now move forward.</li>
                <li>You have chosen <span class="rift-energy">balance over destruction</span> or power. This is the closest thing to a true peaceful resolution in the game.</li>
                <li>This is one of the most satisfying endings for those who sought to do the ‘right thing.’ You did not succumb to power, nor did you obliterate everything—you restored what could be saved.</li>
