        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not fight you. It does not resist. It does not beg.</p>

        <p>It only continues to give.</p>

        <p>The weight of it crushes your mind, an avalanche of knowledge, a tide that will not cease. The history of the world—of every world—pours through you in an unrelenting stream. Truths that no civilization was meant to hold. Patterns that stretch beyond the concept of time itself. The understanding of <span class="rift-energy">everything.</span></p>

        <p>And yet—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You cannot hold it all.</span></p>

        <p>Your thoughts splinter, unraveling into fragments of a self that is no longer wholly human. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> will take you, will make you more, if you allow it. But you feel the edges of yourself slipping, fading. If you do not stop this now, you will not survive it.</p>

        <p>Somewhere in the distance, a voice is calling your name. Distant, familiar, sharp with desperation. It cuts through the flood of knowledge like a blade, an anchor pulling you back toward something small, something fragile, something mortal.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Your own humanity.</span></p>

        <p>You focus on it, reaching for yourself amid the storm of knowing, forcing the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> presence back—not rejecting it, but containing it, shaping it, bending it into something that can be controlled.</p>

        <p>And for the first time—the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> hesitates.</p>

        <p>A ripple of resistance moves through its depths, the vast and infinite threads of possibility tightening, constricting. It has never been denied before. It does not understand refusal.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It does not understand.</span></p>

        <p>But <span class="emphasis">you</span> do.</p>

        <p>Your hands burn with power, your mind screaming as you force the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> closed, not through destruction, but through <span class="rift-energy">finality.</span> You weave the energy inward, severing its reach, folding its limitless potential into something finite—something that can never be used, never be touched again.</p>

        <p>It resists. It fights. But it cannot stop you.</p>

        <p>The sky fractures, the swirling constellations within the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> flickering out like dying embers. The hum that has reverberated through the fabric of existence for as long as history remembers begins to dim, to fade. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is collapsing, sealing itself away, its limitless energy locked beyond the veil of reality.</p>

        <p>And then—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Silence.</span></p>

        <p>You stagger, your body barely holding together, your mind frayed at the edges, but <span class="emphasis">you are here.</span> The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no more. The wound in reality has been closed—not destroyed, not erased, but contained.</p>

        <p>The world is still. The weight of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> pull is gone.</p>

        <p>For the first time, in an eternity that stretches beyond mortal reckoning, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is silent.</p>

        <p>And <span class="rift-energy">you have won.</span></p>

        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer a threat. It is no longer a force waiting to consume or control. <span class="rift-energy">You have sealed it away forever,</span> ensuring that no one will ever wield its power or risk its destruction again.</p>

            <p>But the cost is undeniable—you have seen beyond the limits of human comprehension, and some part of you will never return.</p>

            <p>The world will move forward, free from the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> influence.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">But will it be enough?</span></p>
