        <div class="ending-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not roar.</p>

            <p>It does not convulse, does not lash out, does not resist.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It simply waits.</span></p>

            <p>The final pulse of its energy washes over you, not with force, not with destruction, but with something quiet, something inevitable—as if it had been leading to this moment from the very beginning.</p>

            <p>The air around you stills, thick with gold and violet light, shifting in slow, deliberate patterns, as if the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> itself is breathing. The fractured ground beneath you stabilizes, threads of silver weaving through the darkness, stitching together something unseen, something greater.</p>

            <p>And then you feel it—the weight of choice lifted from you.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">For the first time, you are not the one deciding.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has chosen.</p>

            <p>The pulsing glow around you shifts, deepens, as the world tilts, and a path appears where none should exist. It is not made of stone, nor of stars, nor of anything recognizable. It is woven of possibility, a thread of existence so delicate yet so absolute that you know—stepping forward means leaving everything behind.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> offers no promises.</p>

            <p>No assurances.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">No return.</span></p>

            <p>But you step forward anyway.</p>

            <p>The moment your foot touches the path, the world bends. The sky unfurls, colors bleeding outward in a spiral of crimson, sapphire, and gold, each shade unraveling into something indescribable, something new.</p>

            <p>You feel the weight of the world you once knew begin to slip away—not violently, not cruelly, but gently, like a memory fading into the backdrop of a dream. You do not forget it, but it is no longer yours to hold.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> watches as you cross the final threshold.</p>

            <p>Not as an enemy.</p>

            <p>Not as a ruler.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">But as something more.</span></p>

            <p>The sky around you dissolves, the fabric of what was giving way to what will be. The pulse of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> hums in the distance—softer now, distant, like the final note of a song long since finished.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You step beyond it.</span></p>

            <p>And the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> lets you go.</p>

            <p>The last thing you see before everything shifts—before the final veil is lifted—is light.</p>

            <p>Not a blinding light.</p>

            <p>Not an ending light.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">A beginning.</span></p>

            <p>And then—</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are no longer here.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are somewhere else.</span></p>

                <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has released you—not in destruction, not in conquest, but in acceptance. Unlike any other resolution, this ending is not about power or survival. It is about stepping beyond.</p>

                <p>This is not victory.</p>

                <p><span class="rift-energy">This is departure.</span></p>

                <p>The world you once knew remains behind, untouched by the chaos that once threatened it, forever changed by your presence… but no longer yours to shape.</p>

                <p><span class="rift-energy">You have left everything behind.</span></p>

                <p>Where you have gone…</p>
