        <div class="ending-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> hums, slow and steady now, no longer a chaotic storm but a pulse—patient, deliberate, knowing. It does not pull at you. It does not fight. <span class="emphasis">It simply waits.</span></p>

            <p>Because you are no longer a threat.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are understood.</span></p>

            <p>You step forward, past the war-torn land, past the echoes of those who fought to control what they did not comprehend. The violet light of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> deepens, no longer shifting in wild, erratic spirals, but forming intricate patterns—designs you recognize but cannot name, written in a language that is not spoken, only felt.</p>

            <p>This was never a wound. It was never an anomaly.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It was always meant to be here.</span></p>

            <p>And so were you.</p>

            <p>The figures you glimpsed beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>—their silhouettes suspended in timeless stillness, waiting—are clearer now. They do not move as you approach, yet you feel their presence, their awareness settling over you like the weight of an unseen crown. They are neither alive nor dead. They simply are.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Just as you will be.</span></p>

            <p>You turn back, one last time, looking at the world you are about to leave behind. Ilvane is there, standing at the edge, her breath caught between protest and understanding. The scholars, the soldiers, the ones who followed you this far—they say nothing. <span class="emphasis">They cannot.</span></p>

            <p>How could they speak when they do not understand?</p>

            <p>You smile, not in farewell, not in sorrow, but in certainty.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">They do not need to understand.</span> They do not need to follow. This path was never meant for them.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It was meant for you.</span></p>

            <p>You step into the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>.</p>

            <p>The transition is not violent. There is no tearing of flesh, no unraveling of mind. <span class="emphasis">There is only becoming.</span></p>

            <p>Time ceases to matter. The war, the choices, the struggles—they all fall away, like echoes fading into an ocean of quiet. You are no longer bound by the limits of flesh, by the constraints of history. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not consume you.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It accepts you.</span></p>

            <p>You are not lost. You are not erased.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are more.</span></p>

            <p>Beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, past the veil of existence, a city awaits—a place that is neither ruin nor relic, neither abandoned nor forgotten. The figures who once stood frozen in time begin to shift. Their hollow forms fill with light, their empty gazes turning toward you as if they have been waiting for this moment, for you.</p>

            <p>You step forward, and they part before you, welcoming you into something vast, something infinite.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">A new existence.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">A new beginning.</span></p>

            <p>Something greater than humanity, greater than fate, greater than anything you have ever known.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You have transcended.</span></p>

            <p>And as the last echoes of your old life fade behind you, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses once more.</p>

            <p>Not as an end.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">But as a doorway.</span></p>

            <div class="summary-content">
                <p>You have done what no one else could—you have stepped beyond mortality, beyond the limits of the known world, and into something greater. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was never a force to be controlled or destroyed. It was a bridge, a threshold, a path leading to an existence beyond human comprehension.</p>

                <p>In choosing this path, you do not die, nor do you remain as you were. <span class="rift-energy">You become.</span> You leave behind the struggles of nations, of war, of the mortal cycle, and walk into the unknown, joining the entities beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>—the ones who have always waited for another to take this step.</p>

                <p>You are no longer bound by time.</p>

                <p><span class="rift-energy">No longer shaped by fate.</span></p>

                <p><span class="rift-energy">You are something more.</span></p>

                <p>And you will never return.</p>
