    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> unfurls before you, its colors no longer a chaotic storm but a vast ocean of shifting gold, violet, and obsidian hues. It no longer hums with hunger or violence; it no longer demands.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It simply is.</span></p>

        <p>And as you step forward, you understand.</p>

        <p>You were never meant to rule. You were never meant to fight. The war, the choices, the struggles—they were all echoes of a cycle you were bound to, a loop repeating itself again and again.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">But this?</span></p>

        <p>This is something beyond.</p>

        <p>The air crackles as your form begins to change. Golden light threads through your fingertips, winding through your veins, fracturing the last remnants of your mortal self. Your thoughts stretch, expanding beyond flesh, beyond identity. The weight of time, of past and future, of choice and consequence, peels away like a forgotten name spoken into the wind.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are no longer just a being.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are becoming a force.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> trembles—not in resistance, but in recognition.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">"You are the first,"</span> the voice whispers, though it no longer comes from the Riftborn, nor from any single presence. It is everywhere, woven through existence itself. <span class="rift-energy">"And you will not be the last."</span></p>

        <p>The sky stretches infinitely before you, no longer constrained by horizon or atmosphere. Beyond the Rift’s veil, something waits. Structures of obsidian and light, suspended in an endless void. Beings flickering between time and presence, moving in patterns that make no sense to the mortal mind.</p>

        <p>They are not human. They are not alive. They are not dead.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">And now, neither are you.</span></p>

        <p>You take another step, and the concept of self begins to fade. Your form shifts between energy and memory, your existence unfolding in layers, spreading outward into a new reality that has no shape, no limits, no boundaries.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are no longer bound by time.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">No longer bound by flesh.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">No longer bound by anything at all.</span></p>

        <p>With a final breath, you release everything.</p>

        <p>And you step into the unknown.</p>

        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>You have left behind the limits of humanity, of identity, of existence as it was once known. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was never an obstacle—it was an invitation. A door to something greater, something beyond the reach of mortals. And now, you have crossed through it.</p>

            <p>What lies beyond is unknown.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you will become something new.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you will return, one day, no longer a person, but a force. A whisper in the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> pulse, a traveler of realities unseen.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Or perhaps… you will never be seen again.</span></p>

            <p>For the first time, <span class="rift-energy">you are truly free.</span></p>

    <div class="summary-content">
        <ul>
            <li>You have abandoned the mortal world, choosing to walk beyond the Rift’s horizon into something unknown.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Domination Ending, where you control the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, or the Restoration Ending, where you maintain balance, this path is about <span class="rift-energy">leaving.</span></li>
            <li>This is not an ending of power or destruction, but of transcendence—a final choice to step beyond everything.</li>
            <li>The war, the world, the struggles—none of it matters anymore. <span class="rift-energy">You have gone somewhere beyond their reach.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="final-thought"><span class="rift-energy">The cycle is broken.</span></p>

        <p class="final-thought">The Rift awaits the next traveler.</p>
