        <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift does not rage.</span> It does not scream. It does not fight.</p>

        <p>It merely takes.</p>

        <p>As you step forward, the entity within the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>—watching, waiting, patient beyond time—opens its eyes.</p>

        <p>They are not eyes as you understand them, not spheres of light or shadow, but voids, <span class="rift-energy">endless and consuming.</span> Within them, you see every version of yourself that ever was. A thousand choices. A thousand paths. Every victory, every failure, every possibility stretched across the fabric of time.</p>

        <p>And yet—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">None of them lead here.</span></p>

        <p>You were never meant to arrive at this place. No history records it, no whispers of fate acknowledge it. You stand before something that should not exist—an anomaly in a pattern too vast to comprehend.</p>

        <p>And now, the Rift itself acknowledges this mistake.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-voice">"You should not be."</span></p>

        <p>The voice is not spoken. It is intoned, vibrating through your bones, threading through your mind, laced into the very fabric of what remains of you. It is not anger. Not cruelty. Not even malice.</p>

        <p>It is something far worse.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Indifference.</span></p>

        <p>A hush spreads across reality, vast and suffocating. The Rift tightens around you, not like shackles, not like a prison, but something far more absolute. Its swirling expanse begins to fold in upon itself, collapsing into a singular point of nothingness. Light vanishes. Sound ceases. The weight of existence is undone.</p>

        <p>The ground beneath your feet ceases to exist, yet you do not fall. You are suspended, held within the Rift’s presence, an afterthought in the mind of something far greater.</p>

        <p>Then, piece by piece—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You begin to unravel.</span></p>

        <p>It is not agony. Not pain. There is no violent struggle, no desperate grasp for survival. There is only quiet dissolution—threads of your being pulled loose, one by one, like fibers unspooling from an unfinished tapestry.</p>

        <p>Memories slip away like mist, dissolving before you can reach for them. The weight of your choices, the battles fought, the paths you took to arrive here—gone.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Your name fades next.</span></p>

        <p>You try to hold onto it, but it is already gone. A forgotten whisper on the edge of a dying universe.</p>

        <p>Then, your body.</p>

        <p>Then, the thought that you were ever here at all.</p>

        <p>And finally—</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift, content, forgets you.</span></p>

        <p>With that, you cease to be.</p>

        <p>Not dead.</p>

        <p>Not lost.</p>

        <p>Not waiting beyond the Rift’s edge.</p>

        <p>Simply… <span class="rift-energy">unwritten.</span></p>

            <p>You sought the ultimate truth, and the Rift answered.</p>

            <p>But some truths are not meant for human minds.</p>

            <p>In your pursuit of understanding, you were unmade—not through cruelty, but through the natural order of something far beyond mortal comprehension. <span class="rift-energy">The Rift did not destroy you.</span> It did not consume you.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It merely corrected a mistake.</span></p>

            <p>You are not a warning, nor a lesson.</p>

            <p>You are simply gone.</p>

            <li>This is the **Oblivion Ending**—not of destruction, not of conquest, but **erasure.**</li>
            <li>The Rift is not an enemy. It does not judge. It does not punish.</li>
