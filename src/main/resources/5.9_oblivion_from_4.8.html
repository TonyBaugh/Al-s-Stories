    <div class="ending-title">Oblivion – The Void Claims You</div>

    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The moment your foot leaves the ground and touches the Rift’s threshold, <span class="rift-energy">everything shifts.</span></p>

        <p>It happens so fast, so seamlessly, that at first, you don’t notice. The pulsing energy does not lash out, does not consume you with fire or light. It simply… <span class="rift-energy">accepts.</span></p>

        <p>The resistance you expected, the overwhelming force of something cosmic and unknowable—it never comes. Instead, you pass through the Rift as though stepping into another room, into another world.</p>

        <p>But the world is gone.</p>

        <p>The battlefield, the ruins, the faces of those who stood beside you—<span class="rift-energy">vanished.</span></p>

        <p>There is no wind, no sound, no tether to reality as you once understood it. You stand within a vast expanse, not empty but endless, filled with shifting hues of deep violet and silver, constellations swirling like ink in water. The space around you does not feel like space at all. It is not solid. It is not fluid.</p>

        <p>It simply is.</p>

        <p>You turn, expecting to see the Rift behind you, expecting to see the way you came.</p>

        <p>But there is nothing.</p>

        <p>No exit, no entrance. No direction.</p>

        <p>Just you.</p>

        <p>And then, <span class="rift-energy">the silence begins to crack.</span></p>

        <p>The stars around you flicker. The air—if it can be called air—shudders, vibrating with something just beyond hearing, something pressing against the edges of thought itself. The feeling is not pain, not fear, but something more insidious. A slow unraveling, a sensation of slipping through your own fingers.</p>

        <p class="rift-voice">Who am I?</p>

        <p>But there is no answer.</p>

        <p>You reach for your arm, your fingers, but they are already fading, dissolving into the swirling expanse around you. Not in agony, not in destruction—just in absence.</p>

        <p>There was never a final struggle. No violent consumption, no final words.</p>

        <p>Just a slow, quiet departure from existence, so gentle that you might have believed it was always meant to be this way.</p>

        <p>The Rift had no malice. It did not trick you.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It simply let you go.</span></p>

        <p>And in the end, <span class="rift-energy">you are not erased.</span> You are not consumed.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You simply never were.</span></p>

            <p>In your final act, you stepped forward, trusting in the Rift’s path—believing in escape, in something beyond.</p>

            <p>But there was no revelation, no final confrontation.</p>

            <p>No great unraveling or violent end.</p>

            <p>Instead, you simply… <span class="rift-energy">ceased.</span></p>

            <p>Not erased, not rewritten—just forgotten, piece by piece, until nothing remained.</p>

            <p>The Rift did not devour you. It did not destroy you.</p>

            <p>It simply allowed you to slip through its grasp, through the spaces between existence, until you were no longer something to be remembered at all.</p>
