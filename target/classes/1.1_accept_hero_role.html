    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">You accept the role of the hero, trusting the man's words and preparing to lead once more.</div>
        <hr>

        <p>The man's relieved expression settles over you like a weighted shroud, suffocating yet familiar. There is certainty in his eyes, an unwavering belief that you are something more - something meant for this. His voice is steady, reverent.</p>  

        <p class="dialogue">"We knew you would come back to us,"</p>
        <p>he murmurs, the words a ritual more than a welcome.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"You always do."</p>  

        <p>The certainty in his tone twists something deep in your gut.</p>

        <p class="fade">Always.</p>  

        <p>The word lingers in your mind, reverberating as if it has been spoken before. But how many times? And why can't you remember?</p>  

        <p>The crowd parts as you move, their eyes shifting between awe and wariness. Some lower their heads, their hands trembling over the hilts of their weapons, unsure whether to offer fealty or defend themselves. Others whisper your name - soft as prayer, sharp as a curse. The air is thick with expectation, pressing against you with the weight of a thousand unseen choices.</p>  

        <p><span class="warning">You don't even know who you are.</span></p>  

        <p>The settlement they lead you to is a husk of past glories, a fortress of scars and defiance. Salvaged metal forms jagged walls, bent and reforged countless times over. The remnants of banners, their sigils worn and faded, still flutter weakly against a wind that carries the scent of iron and ash.</p>  

        <p>Your footsteps echo through the streets, where people emerge from the worn shelters of canvas and stone to witness your return. Some drop to one knee in silent reverence. Others avert their gaze, turning away as if unable to reconcile the legend with the person standing before them. A child grips their mother's sleeve, watching you with wide, fearful eyes.</p>  

        <p>A woman steps forward, her presence sharp as steel. Her armor is a patchwork of scavenged plating, <span class="rift">Rift-tempered metal</span> fused into a form that is both battle-worn and commanding. A jagged scar carves across her brow, a relic of wars fought in your name - or against you. She does not kneel.</p>  

        <p class="dialogue">"If you are who they say you are,"</p>
        <p>she says, her voice measured but unyielding,</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"then prove it. Lead us."</p>  

        <p>It is not a request. It is a challenge.</p>  

        <p>You are led deeper into the heart of the settlement, where the weight of history presses upon you. The chamber you enter is lined with relics - tattered banners, rusted weapons mounted like monuments, shattered statues with faces barely distinguishable but eerily familiar. Your name is carved into stone, etched beneath plaques that mark victories long past.</p>  

        <p>The council assembles before you - men and women who have shaped the war in your absence, who have waited for your return with a patience that borders on desperation. Their eyes flicker with something between reverence and hesitation.</p>  

        <p>An elder steps forward, his voice steady despite the weight of his words.</p>  

        <p class="dialogue">"The Rift chose you,"</p>
        <p>he declares.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"It always has."</p>  

        <p>The words settle over you like a verdict, but there is nothing in you to confirm or deny them. The Rift pulses in the distance, its glow casting elongated shadows across the chamber walls. The sigil carved into the stone table before you draws your gaze - its pattern is familiar, a fragment of something lost just beyond your reach.</p>  

        <p>You press your fingers against its surface, and it feels <span class="warning">wrong.</span></p>  

        <p>A shudder of memory threatens to rise, but it never forms, slipping away like mist between your fingers.</p>  

        <p><span class="warning">Is this truly your past? Or are they forcing a story onto you?</span></p>  

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> hums, a slow, steady pulse, as if waiting for you to decide whether to accept the role it has cast upon you - or break free from it entirely.</p>  
    </div>
