<body>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Deny Both Labels</div>

        <p>You take a step back, pulse steady but guarded.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"I'm not who you think I am."</p>

        <p>The man who greeted you stiffens, his expression faltering. <span class="fade">Hope fractures in his eyes</span>, his certainty crumbling like dust beneath an unseen weight. The dagger-wielding woman beside him, however, only tilts her head, something like <span class="warning">amusement</span> flickering across her face.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"That's convenient,"</p> she murmurs.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift pulses</span>.</p>

        <p>It is a low, rhythmic thrum, like a drumbeat just beyond the edge of hearing. The ground trembles beneath its unseen force, sending ripples through the dust, shifting shadows <span class="rift-energy">unnaturally</span>. A few in the crowd stumble, casting wary glances toward the sky—toward the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, where the air itself twists and shudders.</p>

        <p>The air thickens. There is an expectation hanging in the space between you and them, a demand unspoken yet absolute. You were supposed to be something—one thing or another.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">Savior. Destroyer.</span></p>

        <p>Yet, you are neither.</p>

        <p>A murmur passes through the gathered crowd. Some whisper your name. Others shake their heads, unwilling to accept what they are hearing. It is as if they are watching something <span class="fade">unravel</span>, something that was meant to hold their world together.</p>

        <p>Then, from the gathered masses, a figure steps forward.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">They were not there before.</span> You are sure of it.</p>

        <p>The hooded traveler moves with an unsettling grace, their form neither rigid nor loose, their presence neither threatening nor safe. Their voice is quiet, but somehow, it cuts through the silence with the weight of something <span class="rift-energy">inevitable</span>.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Then you must come with me,"</p> they say. <p class="dialogue">"Before it starts again."</p>

        <p>Your shoulders tense.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Before what starts again?"</p>

        <p>They do not answer. Not directly. Instead, they extend a hand. It is steady, waiting, offering nothing but possibility.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Trust me. Or don’t. But if you stay here, you will never know."</p>

        <p>A gust of wind stirs the dust between you, but it is <span class="warning">not natural</span>. It carries no scent, no temperature, just a whispering force that coils between you and the hooded figure. The air bends subtly, as if reality itself is <span class="rift-energy">shifting around them</span>.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift pulses</span> again. Stronger this time. Deeper. Resonant. Vibrating through the air like an <span class="warning">exhaled breath</span>. A warning? A call?</p>

        <p>You glance back at the people watching you. Some are expectant, others wary. But none of them will give you answers.</p>

        <p>The hooded figure waits. Their eyes—hidden beneath the shadow of their hood—do not waver.</p>

        <p>A choice stands before you.</p>

        <p>Do you seek the truth of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>? Do you walk away from it all, leaving war and expectation behind? Or do you take the hand of the unknown, venturing into something that may <span class="rift-energy">change everything</span>?</p>
