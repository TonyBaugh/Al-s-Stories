        <div class="title">Refuse to Choose – Demand the Truth Before You Decide</div>

        <p>You do not speak. You do not move. You do not accept their stories.</p>

        <p>The crowd holds its breath, anticipation thick enough to smother. Some lean forward, waiting for your answer, desperate for you to validate their hopes or justify their fears. Others brace themselves as if expecting a war cry, a declaration, a promise of allegiance or defiance.</p>

        <p>But how can you choose without knowing what is real?</p>

        <p>Your gaze sweeps over them—not as a savior, not as a conqueror, but as an <span class="fade">outsider looking in</span>. You see the weight of expectation on their faces, the way they clutch their weapons, their relics, their whispered prayers like lifelines. They want something from you, something more than just words.</p>

        <p>They want certainty. They want a legend, a nightmare, a god.</p>

        <p>And you <span class="warning">refuse</span>.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“I will not choose,”</p> you say, voice calm but resolute. <p class="dialogue">“Not until I know the truth.”</p>

        <p>The words cut through the silence like a blade. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift pulses</span> behind you, its eerie glow shifting, twisting—as if reacting to your defiance. The moment stretches thin, and for the first time, <span class="warning">uncertainty</span> fractures the gathered masses. Some whisper, shaken. Others recoil, eyes darting between one another, searching for an answer they do not have.</p>

        <p>But one figure does not hesitate.</p>

        <p>From the farthest edge of the gathering, a lone wanderer steps forward. They move without urgency, yet their presence <span class="rift-energy">shifts the air</span>, carrying the weight of something unseen. Unlike the others, their gaze is not filled with expectation, nor fear, nor reverence.</p>

        <p>Their expression is something else entirely—something cold, measured. <span class="fade">Knowing.</span></p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You seek the truth?"</p> Their voice is quiet, steady, and somehow, it cuts through the noise. <p class="dialogue">"Then follow me. But be warned—truth is not always what you wish it to be."</p>

        <p>A murmur ripples through the crowd, but no one stops the wanderer. No one questions them. If anything, they step away, uneasy, as though acknowledging the figure's presence would be <span class="warning">dangerous</span>. Even the woman who clutched her dagger so tightly does not object.</p>

        <p>You glance between them and the wanderer, the weight of unseen eyes pressing down on you.</p>

        <p>A choice stands before you.</p>

        <p>Will you follow the wanderer deeper into the ruins, chasing a truth others fear to speak?</p>

        <p>Will you confront them, demanding to know what they know before taking another step?</p>

        <p>Or will you turn back, unwilling to risk that the truth they offer is worse than the lie?</p>

    </div>
