        <div class="title">=== The March to War ===</div>

        <p>The chamber is silent. Every eye is on you, waiting, judging. The weight of expectation presses against your ribs like an iron clasp, and in that moment, you realize—<span class="warning">there is no turning back.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> chose you. The people believe in you. And whether truth or illusion, belief alone is enough to forge reality.</p>

        <p>Your fingers tighten against the sigil carved into the war table. It feels cold, ancient. A relic of a history you do not remember, yet one that <span class="fade">remembers you.</span></p>

        <p class="dialogue">"We march at dawn."</p>

        <p>The council erupts into motion. Armor is strapped to weary bodies, weapons sharpened against the whetstone, maps scrawled with frantic movements as commanders argue over strategy. Fires burn late into the night, flickering embers casting jagged shadows across the walls of the fortress.</p>

        <p>Your soldiers move like ghosts through the encampment, their voices low, their movements methodical.</p>

        <p>You try to sleep, but the <span class="rift">Rift</span> pulses at the edge of your awareness, a slow and rhythmic thrum, as though it, too, is waiting for the battle to begin.</p>

        <p>Dawn rises, but the light is <span class="warning">wrong.</span></p>

        <p>The sky is fractured—streaks of violet and crimson split the horizon, clashing in restless, shifting patterns. The sun, or what remains of it, is nothing but a hazy smear behind the <span class="rift">Rift’s</span> looming presence.</p>

        <p>The ground beneath your boots is unstable, crimson sands rippling like a living thing beneath the weight of your army’s march. Jagged obsidian formations jut from the earth at unnatural angles, some fused with the twisted wreckage of past battles—rusted weapons, shattered armor, skeletal remains half-buried in <span class="rift">Rift-born</span> stone.</p>

        <p>Your soldiers move in solemn silence, their footfalls swallowed by the thick, oppressive air. The <span class="rift">Rift’s</span> hum is stronger here, vibrating in your skull, filling the space between each heartbeat.</p>

        <p>The whispers begin.</p>

        <p class="fade">"The ones who went before us never returned."</p>
        <p class="fade">"The Rift takes more than it gives."</p>
        <p class="fade">"What if this is a war we already lost?"</p>

        <p>Beside you, Ilvane keeps stride, her posture rigid, her gaze scanning the shifting terrain. The silver streaks in her dark hair catch the eerie glow of the <span class="rift">Rift</span>, turning them almost metallic. She exhales sharply, the first sign of unease you've seen in her.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“They fear what they do not understand,”</p> she murmurs. <p class="dialogue">“And so do I.”</p>

        <p>Her words settle deep, resonating with something unspoken within you.</p>

        <p>Then, the world <span class="warning">twists.</span></p>

        <p>A ripple surges through the landscape, bending the horizon as though seen through fractured glass. The air bends, warps. Shadows stretch impossibly long, cast by no discernible light. And from the <span class="rift">Rift’s</span> glow—<span class="warning">something emerges.</span></p>

        <p>The figure does not step forward—it materializes, coalescing from the shifting haze of the <span class="rift">Rift</span> itself. Their armor does not reflect light—it absorbs it, an abyss of metal that pulses with an eerie, shifting glow. Their presence hums with something beyond comprehension, something <span class="warning">ancient.</span></p>

        <p>They lift a hand. The <span class="rift">Rift</span> pulses in tandem.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You march toward a war you do not understand,"</p> they intone. <p class="dialogue">"Are you prepared to see the truth?"</p>
