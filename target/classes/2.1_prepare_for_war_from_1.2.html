    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Lead Your People to War</div>

        <p>The war council gathers in the great hall, a fortress of <span class="fade">stone and steel</span> that has withstood both time and siege.</p>

        <p>The air reeks of <span class="warning">oil and embers</span>, torches lining the chamber casting jagged shadows against banners <span class="fade">torn and battle-worn</span>. The table before you is a battlefield of its own—maps inked with <span class="warning">blood-red lines</span>, markers placed with the weight of <span class="fade">lives yet to be lost</span>. The room thrums with expectation, with <span class="warning">hunger</span>.</p>

        <p>Every eye is on you.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You’ve seen what they do."</p> 

        <p>The commander’s gauntlet slams onto the table, steel screeching against the wood, leaving deep gouges. <span class="warning">"How many more must we lose before we strike first?"</span></p>

        <p>A murmur spreads through the chamber like wildfire, sparking in the cold steel of their stares. These are not men and women bound by duty alone. They are here because they <span class="warning">crave an answer</span>—one only you can provide.</p>

        <p>Some seek vengeance, others survival, but all of them have chosen you as their <span class="rift-energy">spearhead</span>. Their <span class="rift-energy">general</span>. Their <span class="rift-energy">ruler</span>.</p>

        <p>Beyond the heavy iron doors of the war hall, the world trembles beneath the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s ceaseless pulse</span>. Its glow seeps through the cracks in the stone walls, bleeding hues of shifting <span class="rift-energy">indigo, deep crimson, and eerie violet</span> across the chamber.</p>

        <p>The Rift does not rest. It does not forget.</p>

        <p>It has <span class="rift-energy">given power</span>. It has <span class="warning">taken life</span>. And now, it will be the battlefield upon which you carve your <span class="warning">legend</span> into eternity.</p>

        <p>At the far end of the room, Ilvane stands, arms folded, her silver-streaked hair catching the flickering torchlight. Her gaze is a dagger, unreadable and piercing. She does not fidget, does not speak out of turn. But when she finally does, her voice is as precise as the blade at her hip.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“We march to claim what is ours.”</p>

        <p>Measured. Unwavering.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"But this war is not just steel and blood. The Rift itself is in play. If we move, we must be prepared for the impossible."</p>

        <p>Her words coil around you, planting something deeper than strategy—<span class="fade">doubt?</span> No. Something colder.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">Awareness.</span></p>

        <p>This war will not be won by numbers alone. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not just an obstacle, nor a passive force in the chaos to come. <span class="rift-energy">It is waiting</span>. <span class="rift-energy">It is watching</span>.</p>

        <p>Your soldiers—your <span class="warning">people</span>—watch as well. Their faces lined with the weight of war, of <span class="fade">history rewritten</span> by those too weak to hold the pen.</p>

        <p>But you are no scribe.</p>

        <p>You are no mere player in this game.</p>

        <p>You are the one who <span class="rift-energy">shapes the board itself</span>.</p>

        <p>And yet, how you take control will define <span class="warning">everything</span>.</p>
