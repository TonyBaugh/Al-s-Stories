    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Investigate the Rift’s Nature</div>

        <p>The council chambers buzz with cautious deliberation.</p>

        <p>Maps, records, and fragmented accounts litter the great stone table before you.</p>

        <p>They speak of <span class="rift-warning">war</span>, of seizing power, of striking first before the unknown strikes them.</p>

        <p>But you refuse to be bound by their <span class="rift-warning">fears</span>.</p>

        <p>Too many have carved their graves into the battlefield without ever understanding what they fought against.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“I will not command an army toward an enemy we do not understand.”</p>

        <p>Your words land like iron.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not simply a battlefield.</p>

        <p>It is something <span class="rift-mystery">more</span>.</p>

        <p>A hush follows.</p>

        <p>Some look away, unwilling to challenge you.</p>

        <p>Others glare, distrust flickering behind their eyes.</p>

        <p>Then—</p>

        <p>“You are not the first to seek answers.”</p>

        <p>The elder seated near the fire does not raise his head.</p>

        <p>His hands, weathered with age and ink, tighten against the table.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“But the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not give knowledge freely. It demands something in return.”</p>

        <p>The archives beneath the stronghold are cold, damp with forgotten time.</p>

        <p>Remnants of a <span class="rift-mystery">lost past</span> rest in fragile pages and dust-choked tomes.</p>

        <p>The scholars who dwell here are not warriors.</p>

        <p>Their hands are ink-stained, their eyes shadowed by truths no blade can cut through.</p>

        <p>They whisper of civilizations lost.</p>

        <p>Of kings and scholars who sought the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> secrets—</p>

        <p>Only to be <span class="rift-mystery">erased</span> from history.</p>

        <p>There are maps drawn with trembling hands, marked with <span class="rift-warning">fractures in reality</span>.</p>

        <p>Records of symbols—glyphs carved at the heart of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>.</p>

        <p>Symbols that belong to no known language.</p>

        <p>And then—</p>

        <p>There is the <span class="rift-warning">book</span>.</p>

        <p>Bound in dark leather, cracked with age.</p>

        <p>It sits untouched at the far end of the chamber.</p>

        <p>The scholars do not approach it.</p>

        <p>They do not speak of it.</p>

        <p>But when your fingers brush its cover—</p>

        <p>You swear you feel a <span class="rift-warning">heartbeat</span>.</p>

        <p>One of the scholars steps forward.</p>

        <p>His voice barely above a whisper.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“This was not written.”</p>

        <p>He swallows.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“It was <span class="rift-mystery">remembered</span>.”</p>

        <p>You open it.</p>

        <p>The ink does not sit upon the page.</p>

        <p>It <span class="rift-revelation">moves</span>.</p>

        <p>Living, shifting.</p>

        <p>The words do not wait for you to read them.</p>

        <p>They <span class="rift-revelation">form</span>, as if responding to your presence.</p>

        <p class="rift-revelation">The first Rift was not an accident.</p>

        <p class="rift-revelation">It was a choice.</p>

        <p>A chill coils down your spine.</p>

        <p>You turn the page.</p>

        <p>More words bleed into existence.</p>

        <p class="rift-revelation">The Rift was never meant to be contained.</p>

        <p class="rift-revelation">Only understood.</p>

        <p>The air shifts.</p>

        <p>The candlelight flickers.</p>

        <p>The walls <span class="rift-warning">groan</span>, as if bending under an unseen weight.</p>

        <p>A hum.</p>

        <p>Distant—yet impossibly close.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is listening.</p>

    </div>
