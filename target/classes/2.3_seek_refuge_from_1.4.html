    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">What Happens if You Do Nothing?</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> looms behind you,</p>

        <p>a wound in the sky that refuses to close.</p>

        <p>The people who watch you expect a choice,</p>

        <p>a declaration, an answer.</p>

        <p>But you give them none.</p>

        <p>You turn and walk away.</p>

        <p>Your departure is not met with protests—</p>

        <p>only silence.</p>

        <p>Some watch with quiet disappointment,</p>

        <p>others with confusion.</p>

        <p>But a few... a few seem to understand.</p>

        <p>Not everyone is meant for war.</p>

        <p>Not every path is forged in battle.</p>

        <p>The land beyond the settlement is broken and restless,</p>

        <p>shaped by forces beyond comprehension.</p>

        <p>The sky is a swirling gradient of deep violet and ember gold,</p>

        <p>clouds drifting too slowly,</p>

        <p>as if caught between moments of time.</p>

        <p>The ground beneath your feet is uneven—</p>

        <p>crimson sands shifting over what once might have been a road,</p>

        <p>now long consumed by entropy.</p>

        <p>In the distance, skeletal remains of ancient towers rise</p>

        <p>like the ribs of some long-dead beast,</p>

        <p>their structures cracked and half-sunken into the earth.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">You do not know how long you walk</p>

        <p>before you see it—</p>

        <p>a sanctuary, untouched by war.</p>

        <p>Nestled between fractured hills and jagged spires of obsidian,</p>

        <p>the hidden refuge glows with lantern light.</p>

        <p>Structures of stone and Rift-tempered glass stand defiantly against time,</p>

        <p>woven through with sprawling vines that pulse with faint luminescence.</p>

        <p>The air is thick with the scent of something unfamiliar—</p>

        <p>not decay,</p>

        <p>but something alive,</p>

        <p>something ancient.</p>

        <p>A cloaked figure waits at the entrance,</p>

        <p>their face hidden beneath the deep hood of a traveler.</p>

        <p>When they speak, their voice is calm, measured.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You do not seek war,"</p>

        <p>they say.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You do not seek power.</p>

        <p>But what is it you do seek?"</p>

        <p>You hesitate.</p>

        <p>The question is not an accusation,</p>

        <p>nor a challenge.</p>

        <p>It is an invitation.</p>

        <p>Here, away from the war camps and the scholars</p>

        <p>who whisper of truths beyond comprehension,</p>

        <p>another path exists.</p>

        <p>A path away from war.</p>

        <p>A path away from the <span class="rift">Rift</span>.</p>

        <p>But is that truly possible?</p>

        <p>You step forward,</p>

        <p>the weight of decision settling over you once more.</p>

        <p>The sanctuary is open to you,</p>

        <p>but the choice is yours.</p>

    </div>
