    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Destroy the Rift Immediately</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> looms before you, an open wound festering at the heart of the world.</p>

        <p>It is an insult to order, an affront to dominion. It resists control, distorts reality, and defies logic.</p>

        <p>But all things—no matter how ancient, no matter how untamed—can be <span class="rift-destruction">destroyed</span>.</p>

        <p>And <span class="rift-warning">destruction</span> is your specialty.</p>

        <p>The war room is alight with debate. Commanders stand around the great iron table, maps of the fractured world sprawled before them.</p>

        <p>Thick strokes of <span class="rift-warning">red ink</span> mark Rift anomalies—wounds in the land that spread like an <span class="rift-warning">infection</span>. Some fear it, others seek to exploit it.</p>

        <p>You see only a <span class="rift-destruction">threat</span> that must be erased.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“The Rift is a parasite,”</p> you say, voice cutting through hesitation. <p class="dialogue">“And parasites can be excised.”</p>

        <p>A veteran commander folds her arms, steel glinting beneath the scars.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“And if we fail? If it consumes us before we can strike?”</p>

        <p>You meet her gaze, unyielding.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“If we fail, then we were never meant to win.”</p>

        <p>Your forces assemble before the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, its monstrous radiance pulsing, watching, waiting.</p>

        <p>Weapons forged from shattered civilizations gleam in the Rift’s <span class="rift-energy">unnatural twilight</span>. Siege engines line the valley, their presence a grim promise.</p>

        <p>This is not a battle.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-destruction">This is an execution.</span></p>

        <p>A signal flare erupts—a streak of <span class="rift-energy">violet</span> and <span class="rift-destruction">red</span>—and the first wave of fire rains down.</p>

        <p>Bolts of Rift-tempered steel pierce its glow, vanishing into the abyss like stones swallowed by an ocean.</p>

        <p>Explosions ripple across the horizon—</p>

        <p>—but the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not shrink.</p>

        <p>It does not waver.</p>

        <p>It <span class="rift-warning">reacts</span>.</p>

        <p>A deafening pulse shatters the air, a shockwave ripping through the battlefield with the force of a hurricane.</p>

        <p>Soldiers are flung backward, the earth <span class="rift-destruction">fracturing</span> beneath them. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s glow</span> darkens—</p>

        <p>—not retreating—</p>

        <p>—but <span class="rift-warning">devouring</span>.</p>

        <p>You stand firm. But as the wind howls around you, your mind races.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not <span class="rift-destruction">dying</span>.</p>

        <p>It is <span class="rift-warning">responding</span>.</p>

        <p>And in its response, you feel something far worse than defiance.</p>

        <p>You feel <span class="rift-energy">recognition</span>.</p>

        <p>For a moment—</p>

        <p>The world vanishes.</p>

        <p>You stand at the edge of something <span class="rift-mystery">infinite</span>, something vast and knowing.</p>

        <p>You see glimpses—</p>

        <p>Flashes of history torn apart and rewritten.</p>

        <p>Echoes of battles fought in <span class="rift-warning">cycles beyond comprehension</span>.</p>

        <p>Your own face—</p>

        <p>Staring back at you—</p>

        <p>From <span class="rift-energy">countless reflections</span>.</p>

        <p>Versions of yourself that were.</p>

        <p>That could have been.</p>

        <p>That never were.</p>

    </div>
