    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">Follow the Wanderer into the Unknown</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift-shadow">Rift</span> pulses behind you, a heartbeat in the fabric of reality.</p>

        <p>But you turn away.</p>

        <p>From the voices that call you hero.</p>

        <p>From the ones who brand you villain.</p>

        <p>From those who claim to know who you are.</p>

        <p>Instead, you follow the one figure who does not beg.</p>

        <p>Does not command.</p>

        <p>Does not fear.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">They do not look back.</p>

        <p>They do not ask if you will keep pace.</p>

        <p>This is not a test of obedience.</p>

        <p>This is a test of will.</p>

        <p class="rift-mystery">You chose this path. Now, you must walk it.</p>

        <p>The ruins stretch before you, remnants of a city long devoured by time.</p>

        <p>Twisted spires rise toward the <span class="rift-shadow">Rift-lit</span> sky, their forms warped by forces unseen.</p>

        <p>The air thickens with whispers—</p>

        <p>They do not form words, yet you understand them.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer does not slow.</p>

        <p>At last, they stop.</p>

        <p>A sunken courtyard lies before you, its earth split apart, revealing layers of forgotten history.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Tattered banners hang from broken archways.</p>

        <p>Their symbols lost.</p>

        <p>Their meaning forgotten.</p>

        <p>At the center of the ruins stands a great stone monolith, its carvings shifting as you watch.</p>

        <p>Never the same twice.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer turns at last.</p>

        <p>Their hood slips, just enough for you to see their eyes—</p>

        <p class="rift-mystery">Ancient.</p>

        <p>Knowing.</p>

        <p>Reflecting something vast and distant.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“You are not the first to walk this path,”</p> they murmur. <p class="dialogue">“And you will not be the last.”</p>

        <p>The words settle into your bones.</p>

        <p>Not a warning.</p>

        <p>A certainty.</p>

        <p>You open your mouth to speak—to demand answers—</p>

        <p>To ask why they led you here—</p>

        <p>But the ground beneath you <span class="rift-shadow">pulses.</span></p>

        <p>Not just the earth—</p>

        <p>The air.</p>

        <p>The stone.</p>

        <p>The monolith’s carvings flicker, shifting too fast to follow.</p>

        <p>Wars.</p>

        <p>Betrayals.</p>

        <p>Figures that look like you—</p>

        <p>But are not you.</p>

        <p>Fractured echoes of a past you do not recall.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer watches.</p>

        <p>Unreadable.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“You came seeking answers,”</p> they say. <p class="dialogue">“But will you listen when you hear them?”</p>

        <p>The air shudders.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-shadow">Rift</span> hums.</p>

    </div>
