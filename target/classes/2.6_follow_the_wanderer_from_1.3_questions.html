<div class="choice">1. Seek the truth from the Riftborn scholars. Follow the path of knowledge.</div>
<span class="prompt">"If the Rift remembers, then there are those who have studied its echoes."</span>

<div class="choice">2. Reach for the Rift itself. Embrace what it offers.</div>
<span class="prompt">"It does not give freely. But perhaps, if you take it, it will answer."</span>

<div class="choice">3. Resist both. Walk your own path, beyond war, beyond knowledge, beyond fate.</div>
<span class="prompt">"You were never meant to follow. Not the Rift. Not the Wanderer. Not anything but yourself."</span>

<p class="rift-shadow">The Rift hums.</p>

<p class="rift-warning">It is waiting.</p>

<p class="rift-choice">The choice stands before you.</p>
