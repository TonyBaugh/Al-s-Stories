    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">They Offer an Escape—But at What Cost?</div>

        <p>Something about this place—these people, their stories—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">feels wrong.</p>

        <p>The weight of expectation presses against your chest, suffocating.</p>

        <p>Like a script you were never meant to follow.</p>

        <p>But the Wanderer is different.</p>

        <p>They do not plead for your loyalty.</p>

        <p>They do not demand answers.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">They only wait.</p>

        <p>Their cloak is tattered at the edges,</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">dark fabric shifting like liquid shadow,</p>

        <p>as if the Rift’s energy clings to them.</p>

        <p>Their expression is impossible to read—</p>

        <p class="rift-truth">their eyes holding something far older</p>

        <p>than the people behind you.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You don’t belong here,"</p> they say, their voice carrying over the Rift’s hum.  

        <p class="dialogue">"You feel it, don’t you?"</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">You do.</p>

        <p>A sensation that gnaws at the edges of your mind,</p>

        <p>whispering of a truth you cannot quite grasp.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Come with me,"</p> the Wanderer continues.  

        <p class="dialogue">"Before it’s too late."</p>

        <p>Behind you, murmurs rise.</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">Uncertainty.</p>

        <p>Some whisper your name like a prayer;</p>

        <p>others look away, unwilling to acknowledge what is happening.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">As if they have seen it before.</p>

        <p>You step forward.</p>

        <p>The Rift shudders.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer does not wait for further hesitation.</p>

        <p>They turn—</p>

        <p>moving past the settlement’s crumbling walls,</p>

        <p>stepping into the ruins beyond.</p>

        <p>And you follow—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">not because you trust them,</p>

        <p>but because something deep inside you knows</p>

        <p class="rift-truth">that staying is the greater risk.</p>

        <hr>

        <p class="rift-shadow">The ruins stretch endlessly before you,</p>

        <p>their forms shifting, flickering between</p>

        <p>the remnants of a forgotten civilization</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">and something far stranger.</p>

        <p>Walls rise and fall,</p>

        <p>structures twisting,</p>

        <p>as if time itself is trying to remember</p>

        <p>what this place was supposed to be.</p>

        <p>The sky above fractures with <span class="rift-shadow">violet streaks</span>,</p>

        <p>the air thick with static,</p>

        <p>heavy with something <span class="rift-warning">just beyond comprehension.</span></p>

        <p class="dialogue">"This place existed before the Rift was ever named,"</p> the Wanderer says,  

        <p>their steps light over ground that barely seems real.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"But that doesn’t mean it was ever meant to exist."</p>

        <p>They lead you deeper.</p>

        <p>Past broken pillars where inscriptions have been worn away—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">not by time,</p>

        <p>but by something deliberate.</p>

        <p>Past monuments that seem half-formed,</p>

        <p>figures carved into them flickering between forms,</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">as if their very identities were rewritten.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You wanted to leave,"</p> the Wanderer murmurs.  

        <p class="dialogue">"But do you even know where you would go?"</p>

        <p>The question lingers.</p>

        <p>Because you don’t.</p>

        <p>Because maybe the world beyond this place—</p>

        <p>the one you long to escape to—</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">doesn’t exist anymore.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer slows as the path opens ahead—</p>

        <p>a shattered bridge leading toward a vast, spiraling emptiness.</p>

        <p>The Rift looms beyond it,</p>

        <p>impossibly large,</p>

        <p>its energy not just a tear in the world,</p>

        <p>but <span class="rift-shadow">a wound that never healed.</span></p>

        <p class="dialogue">"If you still wish to leave,"</p> they say,  

        <p class="dialogue">"then cross the bridge."</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"But understand this—"</p>

        <p>they turn to face you,</p>

        <p>expression unreadable,</p>

        <p>but voice heavy with certainty.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Once you step beyond this world,</p>

        <p class="dialogue">there is no coming back."</p>

        <p class="rift-shadow">The Rift pulses—watching.</p>

        <p>The Rift waits.</p>
