    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">It Calls to You. What Will You Become?</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> is no longer just a tear in reality—</p>

        <p>it is a <span class="rift-shadow">presence</span>.</p>

        <p>It pulses, slow and steady,</p>

        <p>like the heartbeat of something immense</p>

        <p>and unseen.</p>

        <p>The world around you is <span class="rift-energy">shifting</span>,</p>

        <p>bending under its influence—</p>

        <p>colors bleed into one another,</p>

        <p>the sky warps between endless night</p>

        <p>and <span class="rift-warning">blinding dawn</span>,</p>

        <p>the ground beneath your feet</p>

        <p>twists in ways that <span class="rift-warning">defy all logic</span>.</p>

        <p>You should be afraid.</p>

        <p>You should turn back.</p>

        <p>But you don’t.</p>

        <p>Because despite everything—</p>

        <p>the warnings,</p>

        <p>the horrors,</p>

        <p>the whispers of those <span class="rift-warning">lost</span> to its depths—</p>

        <p>the <span class="rift">Rift</span> is <span class="rift-energy">calling</span> to you.</p>

        <p>Each step forward feels <span class="rift-shadow">lighter</span>, easier,</p>

        <p>as though the <span class="rift">Rift</span> is drawing you in,</p>

        <p>removing all resistance.</p>

        <p>Shadows stretch and twist along the landscape,</p>

        <p>forming shapes—figures,</p>

        <p>familiar and unfamiliar,</p>

        <p>shifting through the haze of <span class="rift-shadow">time</span>.</p>

        <p>They are not enemies.</p>

        <p>They are <span class="rift-shadow">echoes</span>.</p>

        <p>Memories not just of the past,</p>

        <p>but of every possibility,</p>

        <p>every version of yourself that <span class="rift-shadow">could have existed</span>.</p>

        <p>And they are waiting.</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"You have come far."</span></p>

        <p>The voice is not spoken aloud,</p>

        <p>nor does it come from any single source.</p>

        <p>It resonates from the <span class="rift">Rift</span> itself,</p>

        <p>from the <span class="rift-shadow">space between thoughts</span>,</p>

        <p>the <span class="rift-shadow">silence between heartbeats</span>.</p>

        <p>It is not demanding.</p>

        <p>It is not forceful.</p>

        <p>It simply… <span class="rift-energy">is</span>.</p>

        <p>A figure emerges from the swirling light—</p>

        <p>a form <span class="rift-shadow">half-shaped</span>,</p>

        <p>flickering between human and something <span class="rift-energy">greater</span>,</p>

        <p>their features indistinct,</p>

        <p>shifting between too many possibilities at once.</p>

        <p>They watch you</p>

        <p>with eyes that do not exist,</p>

        <p>yet you <span class="rift-shadow">feel</span> their gaze settle deep</p>

        <p>into your very being.</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"This is what you were meant for."</span></p>

        <p>The air around you crackles,</p>

        <p>charged with energy,</p>

        <p>humming in perfect synchronization with your pulse.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> is no longer something external.</p>

        <p>It is <span class="rift-warning">inside of you</span>,</p>

        <p>something that has <span class="rift-warning">always</span> been there,</p>

        <p>waiting to be acknowledged.</p>

        <p>A thousand voices <span class="rift-shadow">whisper</span> in unison—</p>

        <p>not urging,</p>

        <p>not demanding—</p>

        <p>only <span class="rift-energy">offering</span>.</p>

        <p>You can <span class="rift-energy">feel</span> it—</p>

        <p>the choice settling into your bones.</p>

        <p>To accept the <span class="rift">Rift</span> fully</p>

        <p>is to become something <span class="rift-energy">new</span>,</p>

        <p>to step beyond the boundaries of what you were</p>

        <p>and embrace what you <span class="rift-energy">could be</span>.</p>

        <p>To resist, to fight its pull,</p>

        <p>is to defy a force greater than anything mortal—</p>

        <p>but perhaps,</p>

        <p>that resistance is what makes you <span class="rift-warning">human</span>.</p>

        <p>Or, perhaps,</p>

        <p>there is a <span class="rift-choice">third path</span>.</p>

        <p>To listen,</p>

        <p>to understand,</p>

        <p>to question what even the <span class="rift">Rift</span> itself</p>

        <p>may not <span class="rift-warning">know</span>.</p>

        <p>The shifting form before you</p>

        <p>reaches out a hand—</p>

        <p>not commanding,</p>

        <p>but <span class="rift-energy">inviting</span>.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> pulses,</p>

        <p>waiting.</p>

    </div>
