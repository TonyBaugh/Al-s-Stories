    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">With Power in Your Grasp, Will You Lead?</div>

        <p>The battlefield no longer belongs to mortals.</p>

        <p>The ground beneath your feet <span class="warning">ripples</span>, shifting between solid earth and something far less stable, like a dream struggling to remain whole. The <span class="riftborn">Rift’s glow</span> paints the sky in jagged streaks of violet and gold, casting unnatural shadows across the war-torn land. The air crackles, thick with potential, with <span class="power">power</span> waiting to be seized.</p>

        <p>And in the silence that follows—<span class="riftborn">they kneel.</span></p>

        <p>Not in supplication. Not in fear. <span class="riftborn">But in recognition.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="riftborn">Riftborn</span> do not bow to kings or conquerors. They do not pledge fealty to the weak, nor do they follow without purpose. Their armor gleams with <span class="riftborn">pulsing sigils</span>, shifting in time with the rhythm of the Rift itself. Their weapons hum with restrained energy, a force beyond steel, beyond fire.</p>

        <p>They are not simply warriors. <span class="riftborn">They are the Rift’s chosen.</span></p>

        <p>And now—so are you.</p>

        <p>Ilvane stands rigid beside you, her eyes locked onto the kneeling soldiers with barely contained horror. She has seen countless armies rise and fall, but never like this.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“This isn’t leadership,”</p> she murmurs, her voice edged with something dangerously close to pleading. <p class="dialogue">“It’s surrender.”</p>

        <p>You meet her gaze. The <span class="riftborn">Rift pulses.</span></p>

        <p class="warning">Is it?</p>

        <p>The Riftborn leader rises from the mass of soldiers, their armor catching the shifting hues of the sky. They do not flinch under your scrutiny. They do not demand, nor do they beg.</p>

        <p>Instead, they watch, waiting for you to grasp what they already know.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“There is no path,”</p> they say, voice steady, layered, resonating in a way that makes it difficult to tell if the <span class="riftborn">Rift</span> itself is speaking through them. <p class="dialogue">“Only what you create.”</p>

        <p>Their words settle over you like a weight—like a promise.</p>

        <p>The armies you once led fought for nations, for ideals. They bled and died for power they would never hold.</p>

        <p>But this—this is different.</p>

        <p>The <span class="riftborn">Riftborn</span> do not fear the <span class="riftborn">Rift’s</span> corruption. They have embraced it, become it. If you take command, you will not merely lead them.</p>

        <p><span class="power">You will shape them.</span> Mold them. Turn them into something more.</p>

        <p class="warning">But for what purpose?</p>

        <p>Behind you, Ilvane’s breath is slow and deliberate. Her hand drifts toward the hilt of her blade, but she does not draw it. Not yet.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“If you do this,”</p> she says quietly, <p class="dialogue">“there’s no turning back.”</p>

        <p>Perhaps she is right.</p>

        <p>The <span class="riftborn">Rift pulses</span> again, not in warning, but in expectation.</p>

        <p class="power">What will you do with this power?</p>
