        <div class="title">4:2 Resist the Rift’s Pull</div>

        <p>The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> looms before you, a cosmic wound in reality, pulsing in slow, deliberate waves. The air around it <span class="rift-pulse">shudders</span>, warping in time with its shifting hues—deep violets collapsing into abyssal black, streaks of gold flickering like dying stars.</p>

        <p>Its presence <span class="rift-danger">claws</span> at the edges of your perception, a hum beneath your skin that has grown stronger, threading through your veins like a second heartbeat—persistent, insistent. It does not call you. It <span class="rift-danger">demands</span> you.</p>

        <p>You plant your feet, forcing yourself to resist the pull. The weight of expectation, of fate, of something far older than the war you came here to fight, bears down on you.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">“Whatever it’s doing to you, fight it.”</p>  

        <p>Ilvane’s voice slices through the thick, suffocating air, but you barely hear her. The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> speaks in a language deeper than words, a whisper carved into the marrow of your bones. It is not merely a force—it is something aware. Something <span class="rift-pulse">waiting</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-danger">Then, the vision strikes.</span></p>

        <p>A battlefield stretching beyond time, layered with <span class="fading-echo">echoes</span> of this moment playing out over and over. A thousand selves. A thousand choices. Some march forward into the <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> and vanish. Some kneel before it and rise <span class="rift-danger">changed</span>. Others—too few—turn away, only to be <span class="rift-danger">dragged back</span>.</p>

        <p>One truth binds them all—none have resisted.</p>

        <p class="rift-pulse"><strong>Until now.</strong></p>

        <p>You tighten your grip on reality, on yourself. The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> shudders. It does not like this answer. It does not <span class="rift-danger">understand</span> refusal.</p>

        <p>The ground beneath you <span class="rift-danger">fractures</span>, threads of deep crimson light spilling through the cracks. A soundless scream erupts from the void, and then—they emerge.</p>

        <p>Shadowed figures, half-formed <span class="fading-echo">echoes</span> of those who came before. Their movements are <span class="rift-danger">jagged</span>, unnatural, as if reality itself is unsure whether they should exist. Hollow eyes, swirling with violet flame, fix on you with a hunger that is not their own.</p>

        <p>These are not the fallen.</p>

        <p>These are the ones who <span class="rift-danger">failed</span> to resist.</p>

        <p>A tremor runs through you—not of fear, but of <span class="rift-pulse">resolve</span>. You will <strong>not</strong> become them.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> senses your defiance. The air quakes with its fury, jagged tendrils of energy lashing out, desperate to pull you in. The weight of it is unbearable—like trying to hold back an ocean with bare hands.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-danger">And yet, something shifts.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> wavers, flickers. The voices that have haunted you since this journey began <span class="rift-danger">hesitate</span>. They are not used to rejection.</p>

        <p>For the first time, the <span class="rift-pulse">Rift</span> feels something new.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-danger"><strong>Doubt.</strong></span></p>
