    <div class="story-title">Step Into the Rift’s Depths</div>
    <div class="story-subtitle">The Rift reveals all—do you shape it, or let it shape you?</div>

    <div class="story-content">
        <p>The air around you quivers, thick with the weight of something unspoken, something ancient. 
           The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses ahead, its shifting hues no longer violent, 
           no longer chaotic, but measured—aware.</p>

        <p>You are past the point of return.</p>

        <p>There is no army at your back, no council debating your fate, no battle to be won or lost. 
           The war, the choices, the conflicts of the world behind you—they all feel like echoes, 
           distant and hollow. Here, there is only the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> 
           and what waits beyond it.</p>

        <p>A pressure coils around you, pressing against your skin like unseen hands, not pushing, 
           not pulling—<em>testing</em>.</p>

        <p>A voice, not of words, but of thought, flickers at the edge of your mind.</p>

        <p class="rift-voice">You are not the first to come here.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> shudders, and shadows stretch across the warped terrain. 
           Figures emerge—blurred, shifting, as though caught between realities. Some wear armor, 
           their forms flickering like unfinished thoughts. Others bear the robes of scholars, 
           hands still grasping at knowledge lost to time. They are not whole. They are not broken.</p>

        <p><strong>They are remnants.</strong></p>

        <p>Lost souls, lost selves, reflections of what might have been, what could still be. 
           They move like echoes of forgotten choices, splintered across time. 
           And yet, in all of them, you recognize something familiar.</p>

        <p><strong>You.</strong></p>

        <p>You step forward. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not resist.</p>

        <p>The moment your foot crosses its threshold, sensation fractures.</p>

        <p>The world bends—not violently, not cruelly, but purposefully. 
           Like the careful hands of a sculptor reshaping clay, 
           the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> molds itself around you, 
           adjusting, rewriting, refining.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Reality no longer holds shape.</span> 
           You are falling—or rising. Time compresses, collapses, spreads outward. 
           You see the echoes of past lives, past selves, converging into something singular.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not a wound in reality.</p>

        <p>It is not a mistake.</p>

        <p><strong>It is a design.</strong></p>

        <p>And <em>you</em> are part of it.</p>

        <p>A shimmer of understanding blooms in your mind, 
           unfolding like a thousand-layered puzzle revealing its final truth.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was always waiting.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Not for destruction.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Not for control.</span></p>

        <p><strong>For you.</strong></p>

        <p>For the first time, you have a choice no one before you has had.</p>

        <p>Will you take this power—reshape reality in your image, 
           become the force that others fear or worship?</p>

        <p>Or will you step further, past the known, past the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> itself, 
           to uncover the true purpose behind it all?</p>
