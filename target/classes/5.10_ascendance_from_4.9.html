        <p>The Rift pulses once—deep, resonant, like a heartbeat reverberating across the fabric of existence.</p>

        <p>Then, <span class="rift-energy">everything shifts.</span></p>

        <p>Not in the way of chaos, not like the breaking of reality, nor the molding of something new. This change is subtle, intricate, vast beyond comprehension. The Rift does not consume you. It does not bend to you.</p>

        <p>It <span class="rift-energy">invites</span> you.</p>

        <p>A pathway unfurls before your mind’s eye, not made of stone or light but of possibility. Threads of shimmering gold weave through the abyss, trailing off into an expanse that should not exist—a canvas untouched by mortal hands.</p>

        <p>Landscapes form in the distance, impossibly vast, shifting as if caught between thought and reality. Living constellations swirl above, rivers of liquid time stretch across the horizon, and in the far distance, a city flickers—a place without boundaries, where spires rise and fall like breath.</p>

        <p>It is not a place.</p>

        <p>It is not a realm.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It is the next step.</span></p>

        <p>The weight of the world you leave behind presses against your back—history, conflict, choices that no longer matter. The echoes of those who sought the Rift’s power, those who fled from it, those who tried to destroy it—they remain behind, frozen at the edge.</p>

        <p>They cannot follow.</p>

        <p>But you?</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are not bound.</span></p>

        <p>A final whisper hums through the Rift, threading through every particle of your being. It does not speak in words, nor thought, nor song.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-voice">It speaks in understanding.</span></p>

        <p>And then, you step forward.</p>

        <p>The moment your foot leaves the Rift’s plane, you feel it—an unraveling, not of you, but of everything that ever tethered you to a singular reality. Your name, your past, your choices—they remain, but they are no longer chains.</p>

        <p>You ascend beyond the Rift, beyond the known cosmos, beyond the very notion of limitation.</p>

        <p>A universe that has yet to be written stretches before you, waiting. Not for a ruler. Not for a conqueror.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">For a traveler.</span></p>

        <p>For the first time, you do not feel the weight of fate pressing upon your shoulders.</p>

        <p>For the first time, you are free.</p>

        <p>And so, <span class="rift-energy">you go.</span></p>

        <p>Beyond the Rift.</p>

        <p>Beyond the End.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Beyond Everything.</span></p>

            <p>This is the **Ascendance Ending**, the rarest and most hidden path in *Echoes of the Rift*. Unlike every other choice, this ending is not about power, resistance, or destruction—it is about **transcendence**.</p>

            <p>The Rift was never a prison, never a wound, never a mistake.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It was a doorway.</span></p>

            <p>And you were the key all along.</p>

            <p>By embracing the unknown, you leave behind the mortal conflicts of the world, ascending to a plane beyond comprehension, a place where existence itself is rewritten in infinite possibility.</p>

            <p>You are no longer a mere figure in history.</p>

            <p>You are a traveler at the edge of what comes next.</p>
