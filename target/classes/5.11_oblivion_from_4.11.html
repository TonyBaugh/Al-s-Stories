    <div class="ending-title">Oblivion – The Eternal Witness</div>

    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The Rift has decided.</p>

        <p>It does not erase you.</p>

        <p>It does not consume you.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It does not let you go.</span></p>

        <p>A pulse of violet and silver light erupts outward, soft at first, like the exhale of something infinite. You brace for oblivion, for the end of all things, for the dissolution of self.</p>

        <p>But the end never comes.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You remain.</span></p>

        <p>But the world does not.</p>

        <p>Reality around you fractures, warps, dissolves into an ocean of shifting light—but you do not dissolve with it. Instead, you slip between the cracks, caught in the space beneath existence, in the threads between what was and what will be.</p>

        <p>You are <span class="rift-energy">outside of time.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Outside of the world.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Outside of everything.</span></p>

        <p>The Rift does not devour you. It does not break you apart. It preserves you—locks you in place, forever unchanging, forever watching.</p>

        <p>You see the world reform.</p>

        <p>You see civilizations rise, fall, rise again.</p>

        <p>You see the Rift whisper to another, just as it whispered to you. You see them struggle, fight, choose—just as you did. You see their victories, their failures, their deaths.</p>

        <p>You see the Rift swallow them whole.</p>

        <p>And <span class="rift-energy">you remain.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You always remain.</span></p>

        <p>Eternity stretches before you like a road with no end. You try to move, to speak, to reach out, but the world does not hear you. You are not a ghost, not a memory, not even a shadow.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are a witness.</span></p>

        <p>Nothing more.</p>

        <p>Nothing less.</p>

        <p>You watch the Rift play the same story, again and again, an endless cycle of fate, of ruin, of possibility. You see the echoes of your own choices—sometimes reflected in others, sometimes lost entirely.</p>

        <p>But you?</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You will never be lost.</span></p>

        <p>You will never be forgotten.</p>

        <p>You will never be anything but this.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">The eternal observer.</span></p>

        <p>The silent witness to the rise and fall of every story the Rift will ever tell.</p>

        <p>And no one will ever know you are there.</p>

            <p>This is the **Eternal Witness Ending**, the most unique **Oblivion** fate. Unlike the others, where the player is erased or consumed, this ending is far worse—they are preserved, locked outside of reality, unable to act, unable to be remembered, unable to die.</p>

            <p>The Rift did not destroy you.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It did not forget you.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">It trapped you.</span></p>

            <p>You have become something beyond time, a prisoner of eternity itself. You are there to watch, forever.</p>

            <p>And <span class="rift-energy">you will never escape.</span></p>

            <li>**You will never influence anything ever again. The Rift has made sure of that.**</li>
            <li>**This is a fate worse than erasure—you are eternal, but utterly powerless.**</li>
