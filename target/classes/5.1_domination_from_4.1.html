        <div class="title">Controlling the Rift</div>

        <p>The battlefield is no more.</p>

        <p>The armies that once clashed upon the shifting sands of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> are silent, kneeling before the <span class="rift-command">power you now wield</span>. The <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span> do not resist you; they recognize what you have become. The world bends, the sky fractures, and the last remnants of opposition crumble beneath the weight of inevitability.</p>

        <p>You stand at the center of it all, the pulse of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> no longer a force beyond comprehension but a rhythm that beats in sync with your own. It does not resist you.</p>

        <p class="rift-command">It obeys.</p>

        <p>What was once untamed chaos now flows through you in perfect synchronicity, responding to your will with absolute reverence. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer a threat. It is no longer a mystery.</p>

        <p class="rift-command">It is yours.</p>

        <p>The world watches in stunned silence, held in the gravity of this moment. Some fall to their knees, heads bowed in devotion, sensing the tides of power shifting irreversibly. Others refuse to submit, their fear twisting into <span class="rift-warning">defiance</span>. You see it in their eyes—the desperate hope that you can still be stopped.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">But hope is a fragile thing.</p>

        <p>You raise a hand, and the <span class="rift-energy">Rift answers</span>.</p>

        <p>The air trembles as its energy surges outward, threading through every corner of existence. The skies darken, then blaze with <span class="rift-command">impossible colors</span>. Cities long turned to dust rise again, their stones reshaping as though time itself rewinds at your command. The land warps, reshaped not by the slow hand of nature, but by your **will** alone.</p>

        <p class="rift-command">This is no longer a world bound by chance.</p>

        <p>It is **your** world now.</p>

        <p>The rulers of kingdoms, the scholars who once sought to tame the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, the warriors who fought to destroy it—they all watch in stunned disbelief. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s great mystery</span> has been solved, its uncontrollable force **tamed**.</p>

        <p>The impossible has become reality.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Some will call you a god.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">Some will call you a tyrant.</p>

        <p>It does not matter.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-command">You have already won.</span></p>

        <p>With every pulse of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, new possibilities unfold before you. Time bends. Reality reshapes. The very essence of existence waits, eager to be sculpted into whatever vision you choose.</p>

        <p class="rift-command">What will you do with it?</p>

        <p>You could forge a golden age, shaping a perfect world without war, without suffering—without the weaknesses that once doomed civilizations to ruin.</p>

        <p>Or you could rule as an **absolute force**, reshaping time and history as you see fit, crafting an empire that will never crumble, because **reality itself will not allow it**.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps, you will reach even farther—beyond this world, beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> itself, into the very fabric of the unknown.</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">What lies beyond the Rift’s reach?</p>

        <p class="rift-warning">What lies beyond you?</p>

        <p>The choice is no longer the world’s to make.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-command">It belongs only to you.</span></p>

        <p>And with a final breath, you step forward, leaving behind the echoes of what was, and shaping the dawn of what will be.</p>

        <p class="rift-command">Because in the end, all of existence will bow to you.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="summary-title">Summary - Domination</div>
        <div class="summary-content">
            The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> no longer threatens to consume you, nor does it control you. 
            <span class="highlight">It is yours to wield.</span>  
            The world bends beneath its <span class="highlight">new master</span>. The laws of nature—of time, space, and even mortality—become tools in your hands.  
            Some will call you a <span class="highlight">savior</span>, others a <span class="highlight">tyrant</span>, but their words do not matter.  
            You shape <span class="highlight">reality itself now</span>, and none can challenge your dominion.  
            The question is not <span class="highlight">whether you will rule</span>, but <span class="highlight">what kind of ruler you will become</span>.
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="player-reflection">What This Means for the Player</div>
        <div class="summary-content">
            This is the <span class="highlight">ultimate power fantasy</span>, where you are no longer just reacting to the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> 
            but <span class="highlight">controlling it outright</span>.  
            The world no longer acts upon you—you act <span class="highlight">upon it</span>.  
            This path grants absolute <span class="highlight">agency and triumph</span>, but also responsibility.  
            Will you <span class="highlight">use this power wisely</span>, or <span class="highlight">selfishly</span>?  
            The game does not tell you—<span class="highlight">only you can decide</span> if your reign brings <span class="highlight">enlightenment or oppression</span>.  
            But beneath the triumph, a question lingers—  
            <span class="rift-warning">If nothing can stand against you... then what remains to challenge you?</span>
