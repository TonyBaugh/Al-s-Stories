        <p><span class="rift-energy">They trusted you.</span></p>

        <p>They followed you across burning battlefields, through shifting realities, into the very heart of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> itself. And now they stand at your back, waiting for the command that will end everything.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> churns before you, its depths roiling in violent defiance, resisting what it already knows is coming. Its energy writhes, pulsing like a wounded beast backed into a corner—desperate, chaotic, but no longer in control. The <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span> at your side, those who have sworn allegiance to your vision, watch in silent anticipation. They, too, can feel it—the end of something vast, something greater than any of them have ever known.</p>

        <p>"You hesitate," one of them murmurs, their voice hollow with uncertainty. "After everything… would you truly erase it?"</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> flares, a deafening pulse tearing through the sky, splitting it into streaks of crimson fire and shadowed violet. The world screams. Reality bends, contorting as the weight of what you are about to do fractures its foundation. And in the chaos, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> whispers—not in words, but in the silent terror of something ancient that does not want to die.</p>

        <p>But it must.</p>

        <p>You inhale, feeling the power thrumming beneath your skin, the <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span> army behind you holding their breath. Some watch in reverence. Others in doubt. This is not just destruction. This is an execution.</p>

        <p>Your hands burn as you summon the final strike, drawing upon everything that has led you here. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> shrieks—a soundless wail that carves into your bones, twisting through your mind like an unraveling thread. It knows. It begs. It promises.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">But you have already made your choice.</span></p>

        <p>With a single, final command, you end it.</p>

        <p>The world erupts in blinding light—gold and midnight blue colliding in a final, cataclysmic rupture. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not explode outward. It does not shatter. It implodes, collapsing into itself, devouring every trace of its existence until all that remains is silence.</p>

        <p>The sky smooths, its fractures sealing as if nothing had ever been torn. The air stills. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is gone.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">But the world does not cheer.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span> look to you now, their purpose fulfilled, their expressions unreadable. Some drop to their knees in quiet reverence. Others lower their weapons, uncertain. Without the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, without the force that shaped their existence, what remains for them?</p>

        <p>And what remains for you?</p>

        <p>You turn to face this unshaped world, stepping forward into a future that is no longer dictated by a force beyond comprehension. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> influence is gone. History will be written by mortal hands alone.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">But in the quiet that follows, in the void left behind… a thought lingers.</span></p>

        <p>If the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was capable of rewriting reality—if it was truly the force that shaped fate—then what happens to a world that no longer has it?</p>

        <p>And as you step into the unknown, the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> final pulse echoes somewhere deep in your bones.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">A ghost of something that will never truly die.</span></p>

        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has been erased, and with it, the force that shaped history itself. Those who followed you into its depths now stand in silence, their purpose fulfilled, yet uncertain of what remains. Without the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> influence, the world is free—but freedom comes at a cost. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was more than chaos. It was a force woven into the very fabric of reality. Without it, what happens to the world it left behind?</p>
