    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> convulses, a maelstrom of swirling violet and obsidian, its form warping, twisting, collapsing in on itself like a dying star. The sky fractures above, veins of gold and crimson searing through the darkness, burning away the remnants of what once was. The ground beneath you heaves, trembling as though the world itself is recoiling from what is about to happen.</p>

        <p>But you do not falter.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You deny the Rift.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You reject its existence.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You end it.</span></p>

        <p>A force erupts from your being, not of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> making, not of some unknowable power—it is yours. Your will becomes a blinding storm of pure unmaking, a force so absolute that the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, for all its vastness, its eternity, its unknowable depths, begins to shatter.</p>

        <p>It screams.</p>

        <p>Not in sound. Not in words. But in the very fabric of reality, a desperate, violent thrashing as it fights against the inevitable. Tendrils of energy lash out, wild and erratic, trying to find something—anything—to hold onto.</p>

        <p>But there is nothing left for it to grasp.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You burn it away.</span></p>

        <p>The world around you unravels, crumbling into motes of silver dust as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> collapses further, its great wound upon existence sealing not with careful precision, but with raw, final destruction. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was never meant to be sealed. It was never meant to be contained.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It was meant to be ended.</span></p>

        <p>And so, you do.</p>

        <p>The last remnants of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> detonate outward, a shockwave of finality that ripples across the very bones of reality. The sky—once torn and bleeding—turns black. The land—once twisted and warped—splinters into nothingness. The very concept of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, of its power, of everything it had ever touched—is erased.</p>

        <p>And then… silence.</p>

        <p>A silence so deep, so profound, that for a moment, it feels as though nothing will ever exist again.</p>

        <p>You stand upon the ruins of what once was. But there are no ruins, are there? No remnants, no scars.</p>

        <p>Only emptiness.</p>

        <p>You look beyond the horizon, but there is no horizon left.</p>

        <p>You look toward the sky, but the sky has been wiped clean.</p>

        <p>You look down at your hands, and for the first time, they do not tremble with power.</p>

        <p>Because there is nothing left to fight.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Nothing left to destroy.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Nothing left at all.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has been erased—not just destroyed, but completely removed from existence. Its power, its corruption, its very presence has been unmade.</p>

            <p>But so has everything else.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">The world that warred over it, the knowledge it held, the echoes of all who ever touched it—all of it is gone.</span> Not by accident. Not by chaos. By your will.</p>

            <p>This is not just the end of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">This is the end of everything.</span></p>

        <ul>
