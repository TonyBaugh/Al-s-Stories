    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> hums, expectant, patient. The world trembles at the threshold of change, waiting for your decision. Power stands at your fingertips—not as a weapon, not as a throne, but as something far more profound. A choice. A burden. A final act.</p>

        <p>You stand at the precipice of possibility, surrounded by <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span> warriors who would march at your command. Yet, as you look into their unwavering eyes, something settles within you—a certainty that power alone is not the answer.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not just an anomaly. It is not simply a force to be harnessed or destroyed. It is a wound, a fracture carved into existence itself. It does not rage mindlessly. It does not hunger for destruction. It simply is. And it will remain unless someone—something—closes it.</p>

        <p>Ilvane steps closer, her expression unreadable. <span class="rift-dialogue">“You don’t have to do this.”</span></p>

        <p>But she knows the truth as well as you do. If the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is to be sealed, it requires more than force. It demands sacrifice.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> stirs, light spilling from its core in luminous waves, wrapping around you like the whisper of a thousand unseen hands. It is not malicious. It is not cruel. It merely waits for you to take the final step.</p>

        <p>And so, you do.</p>

        <p>A breath. A step forward.</p>

        <p>Energy surges through your body, filling every part of you with a sensation beyond pain, beyond fear. The world around you dims as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulls you into its depths—not as a prisoner, but as a keystone, a force strong enough to stabilize the unraveling threads of reality. The figures around you call out—some in horror, others in reverence—but their voices are distant, as though heard through the filter of another existence.</p>

        <p>Your body is no longer flesh, no longer bound to the limitations of mortality. You are neither whole nor lost. You are something else entirely.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> trembles, then stills.</p>

        <p>A great silence falls across the battlefield. The sky, once fractured and bleeding with impossible colors, begins to mend. The shifting landscape settles, solidifying into something stable, something real. The war ends not with conquest, not with annihilation, but with resolution.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are gone.</span></p>

        <p>Yet, you remain.</p>

        <p>Your name is spoken in hushed tones by those who witnessed your final act. Some call you a savior, the one who tamed the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> with a sacrifice no other could bear. Others fear that you have not truly disappeared—that the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> still lingers in some unseen place, waiting for the day when your will might return.</p>

        <p>Time passes. The world rebuilds. And though the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is sealed, its echo remains—a whisper, a presence, a guiding force for those who still remember.</p>

        <p>And somewhere, beyond the veil of existence, something watches.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">Waiting.</span></p>

        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is sealed, but at the cost of your own existence. No throne, no victory, no final glory—only the knowledge that the world is safe. For now.</p>

            <p>You have become something beyond human comprehension, a force that lingers at the edges of reality, keeping the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> power contained. Whether this is true salvation or merely another form of sacrifice is unknown.</p>

            <p>But one thing is certain—the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer a threat.</p>
