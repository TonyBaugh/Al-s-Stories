        <div class="ending-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> watches. It does not command, does not beg, does not force. It waits.</p>

            <p>You have seen beyond it, glimpsed what was never meant to be known. The echoes of a lost civilization, frozen in time, their presence lingering at the edge of comprehension. You understand now—this was never just a wound in reality. It was a construct. A gate. A choice.</p>

            <p>And now, that choice is yours.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses, its tendrils of shifting violet and gold undulating like the slow pull of an unseen tide. It reaches for you—not as a devourer, not as a force of destruction, but as something searching. Seeking balance. Seeking completion.</p>

            <p>You understand now.</p>

            <p>You step forward, and the world blurs. The air thickens, folding in on itself. The voices that have whispered in your mind since the beginning—the ghosts of those lost to the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, the echoes of those who came before—grow silent. Not because they have vanished, but because they are listening. Watching.</p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not an entity, not a presence that wills itself upon the world. It is a force left behind, an engine still running long after its creators have faded. It has never been whole, never been complete. It has existed in imbalance, trapped between realms, spilling into existence like an overfilled vessel with no anchor.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Until now.</span></p>

            <p>Your body feels lighter, the weight of mortality slipping from your shoulders. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> hums in understanding, in acceptance. You are not fighting it. You are not resisting. You are becoming what was always missing.</p>

            <p>A keystone.</p>

            <p>The pulse of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> slows, its storm of wild energy stabilizing, falling into a steady, rhythmic beat—one that aligns with your own. The sky, once fractured with streaks of chaotic light, smooths into a steady, shifting aurora, no longer tearing itself apart. The land ceases to ripple, the endless distortions folding back into something resembling stability.</p>

            <p>The world exhales.</p>

            <p>Ilvane calls your name, but her voice is distant, as if carried on a wind you can no longer feel. The figures behind her—soldiers, scholars, survivors—watch with something between awe and sorrow. They know. Even if they do not understand, even if they never will, they know.</p>

            <p>You smile.</p>

            <p>And then—</p>

            <p>You are gone.</p>

            <p>Not consumed. Not destroyed. <span class="rift-energy">You become.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not collapse, nor does it remain as it was. It shifts, its presence still lingering, but no longer a threat. It no longer warps time, no longer hungers for more. The whispers fade. The storms cease.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">Balance is restored.</span></p>

            <p>And though no one sees you anymore, though no one hears your voice, a single truth remains, carried in the breath of the wind, in the stillness of the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> glow.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are still here.</span></p>

            <p>Watching.</p>

            <p>Guarding.</p>

            <p>Ensuring that the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, and all it touches, will never spiral into chaos again.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are the keystone.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are the balance.</span></p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You are eternal.</span></p>

                <p>You did not destroy the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>. You did not conquer it. <span class="rift-energy">You became part of it</span>, filling the gap left behind by those who created it, bringing stability to a force that was never meant to be left untethered. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer a threat, no longer an anomaly of chaos—it exists now in harmony with the world, neither destructive nor uncontrollable. But in doing so, you have sacrificed yourself.</p>

                <p>Your presence lingers, unseen but felt, an unseen guardian keeping the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> in check. To the world, you have vanished, but you are not truly gone. <span class="rift-energy">You are something more</span>, something beyond mortality, bound to the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> as its keystone, forever maintaining its balance.</p>

                <p>A sacrifice, yes. But also, a purpose.</p>
