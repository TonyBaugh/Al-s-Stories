    <div class="ending-content">
        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> writhes in protest, its luminous tendrils lashing at the fabric of reality itself. It senses what you are about to do, and for the first time, something akin to fear pulses through its chaotic form. It has endured eons unchecked, rewriting history, bending time, weaving itself into the very essence of existence. But now, it will be locked away. Not destroyed, not unmade—simply sealed.</p>

        <p>The air thickens with tension as you step forward, placing a hand against the void’s shifting surface. The sensation is neither hot nor cold, neither solid nor fluid—it is everything and nothing at once. It pushes back against your touch, but you push harder, drawing upon every ounce of strength, every fragment of willpower left in you.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> fights.</p>

        <p>It howls through the minds of those nearby, screams in a thousand overlapping voices—voices of those it has claimed, those who have tried to understand it, those who have failed. The sky fractures, streaked with unnatural hues, as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> chaotic power surges against your final act.</p>

        <p>But you are unmoving. Unyielding.</p>

        <p>Your hands burn as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift’s</span> energy lashes at you, but you do not let go. You do not falter. This is not a battle of strength, nor of war—it is a battle of will. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has shaped existence for too long, whispering into the fabric of reality, waiting for the next desperate soul to claim its power. But no more.</p>

        <p>The process is agonizing, as though you are forcing the world to reset, to forget what the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> once was. The jagged wound in the sky shrinks, its glow dimming, its grip loosening. With each passing moment, its voice fades—first to a whisper, then to silence. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> twists upon itself, shrinking, collapsing inward like a dying star.</p>

        <p>Then—</p>

        <p>A final, shuddering pulse.</p>

        <p>A last flicker of resistance.</p>

        <p>And then—nothing.</p>

        <p>The air stills. The sky smooths into endless twilight, the unnatural storm fading into quiet peace. The earth beneath your feet no longer shifts, no longer quivers with uncertainty. The weight that has pressed upon the world, upon you, is gone.</p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is sealed. <span class="rift-energy">Forever.</span></p>

        <p>Ilvane stares at the empty sky, her breath unsteady. <span class="rift-dialogue">“It’s… gone?”</span> Her voice is barely above a whisper.</p>

        <p>No. Not gone. But caged. Bound. Never to be touched again.</p>

        <p>And yet, deep inside, you know—somewhere beyond perception, beyond mortal comprehension—the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> still exists. It is watching. Waiting. And if the seal ever breaks…</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">No.</span></p>

        <p>You take a final breath, turning away. The world is safe. For now.</p>

        <div class="summary-title">Summary – Restoration: Sealing the Rift</div>
        <div class="summary-content">
            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is no longer a force looming over existence. You did not destroy it, nor did you claim its power—you sealed it away, locking its influence beyond the reach of mortals. With your final act, you have ensured that the chaos it once unleashed will never return. The world is free from its grasp.</p>

            <p>Yet, something lingers beneath the surface—an uncertainty, a weight left unspoken. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not gone. It cannot be erased so easily. It has simply been locked away, waiting in silence, held at bay by your will. But for how long?</p>

            <p>The world moves forward, history resets, civilizations rebuild. And yet, the question lingers in the deepest corners of time itself—<span class="rift-energy">was this truly the end?</span></p>
