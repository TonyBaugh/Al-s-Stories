    <div class="ending-content">
        <p><span class="rift-energy">You step forward.</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> does not resist. It does not consume.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It opens.</span></p>

        <p>A soundless rupture spreads outward, the fabric of existence splitting apart like the surface of a still lake touched by something beyond comprehension. The sky bends, the stars shudder, the very air unravels into streaks of deep indigo and luminous gold. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> expands—not in hunger, not in destruction, but in welcome.</p>

        <p>It has been waiting for you.</p>

        <p>Your body is weightless as you cross the threshold, gravity losing its meaning, sensation slipping through your fingers like grains of sand. Time bends, snapping apart like fragile glass, reassembling itself into something new. For a single, infinite moment, you exist in every possibility—every choice, every version of yourself that ever was, that ever could have been.</p>

        <p>Then, silence.</p>

        <p>You stand in a space beyond space.</p>

        <p>A city unfolds before you—not built by hands, not bound by mortal architecture. Vast towers of liquid obsidian stretch into an eternal sky of shifting constellations. The ground beneath you is not solid, but it holds you as though it remembers your weight. The air hums with a resonance that vibrates through your bones, filling the silence with a presence—an understanding.</p>

        <p>And you are not alone.</p>

        <p>Figures stand in the distance, motionless, waiting. Their forms flicker at the edges, shifting between human and something far more. They are not <span class="rift-energy">Riftborn</span>. They are not echoes. They are something else entirely.</p>

        <p>Then, one of them steps forward.</p>

        <p>Their form stabilizes as they approach, coalescing into something both familiar and impossible. They bear no face, yet you know them. They do not speak, yet you hear them.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">“You were never meant to find this place.”</span></p>

        <p>The words are not a warning. They are a realization.</p>

        <p>They raise a hand, and the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses behind you—no longer a force of chaos, but a doorway, perfectly aligned, its edges smooth, its presence serene.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It was never broken.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It was never uncontrolled.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It was always leading here.</span></p>

        <p>“You have seen what others could not,” the figure continues. “You have stepped beyond the cycle, past the veil of what was meant to be understood.” They tilt their head, observing you as if you are both an anomaly and an inevitability. “Now, the question is not whether you belong here.”</p>

        <p>Their voice lingers in the air like a final breath.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">“The question is… what will you become?”</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> pulses one final time, and you understand.</p>

        <p>You are not trapped. You are not lost.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You are ascending.</span></p>

        <p>The choices of mortals, the wars fought for control, the endless struggle to contain what could never be contained—it all seems so small now.</p>

        <p>Here, beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, existence is no longer defined by the limitations of humanity.</p>

        <p>Here, you are no longer bound by time, by fate, by the constraints of what the world believed to be possible.</p>

        <p>You step forward, into the unknown, into a new reality unshaped by past or present.</p>

        <p>And as the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> closes behind you, its purpose fulfilled, the last echoes of the world you left behind fade into silence.</p>

        <p>But you do not vanish.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">You become.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was never a wound. It was never a mistake. It was a doorway, hidden beyond the reach of history, waiting for the one who would find it. And you did.</p>

            <p>Stepping through the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was not an act of destruction, nor submission. It was an act of realization. You were never meant to stay. <span class="rift-energy">You were meant to evolve.</span></p>

            <p>Beyond the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> lies something greater than knowledge, greater than power. It is understanding beyond the limits of mortal minds. And you have become part of it.</p>

            <p>You have not escaped. <span class="rift-energy">You have transcended.</span></p>

            <p>And now, you stand among those who have done the same before you, those who have seen beyond reality’s veil and chosen something more.</p>

            <p>The world will never know what you became.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">But the Rift will never need to open again.</span></p>

            <p>Because <span class="rift-energy">you</span> are now its answer.</p>
