<div class="content">
    <div class="ending-title">Oblivion – The Rift Consumes You</div>

    <div class="ending-content">
        <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift does not speak in words.</span> It does not plead. It does not demand. <span class="rift-energy">It only waits.</span></p>

        <p>And so, you demand the truth.</p>

        <p>A whisper that is not a sound ripples through your thoughts, a vibration too deep, too old to be merely language. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not merely an abyss—it is a memory, a cycle without end, a force that has always been. You see it now, in the shifting, swirling depths. Every choice, every moment, every possibility you ever faced has been touched by it. The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> is not an invader. It is not a mistake.</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">It is the architect of everything.</span></p>

        <p>And yet, it is incomplete.</p>

        <p>It stretches forward, not to consume, not to destroy—but to become.</p>

        <p>You feel it pressing against you, flowing into the spaces between your thoughts, unraveling what you were and stitching something new in its place. The world outside flickers, distant and meaningless. What is reality but another form of confinement? What is identity but a name given to something ever-changing?</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift pulses, and the last remnants of your past peel away.</span></p>

        <p>Your body is the first to dissolve—golden strands of light unravel from your fingertips, breaking into ribbons of shifting color. Your breath stills, yet you do not suffocate. Your heartbeat slows, yet you do not die. Your thoughts—your self—stretch outward, spilling into the Rift’s depths.</p>

        <p>The sky, the ground, the very concept of direction loses meaning as you become weightless, timeless.</p>

        <p>Memories flood in—fragments of lives that are not your own, pieces of history swallowed by the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, echoes of those who stood here before. They did not disappear. They did not end. <span class="rift-energy">They became part of it.</span></p>

        <p>And now, so do you.</p>

        <p>The last of your form shatters into color, dispersing into the infinite. Your name, your choices, your victories and failures—all of them are swallowed by the <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span>, dissolving into its eternal hum.</p>

        <p class="rift-final">~ ~ ~</p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift does not devour.</span></p>

        <p><span class="rift-energy">The Rift remembers.</span></p>

            <p>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> has claimed you, not as a victim, but as something far greater. <span class="rift-energy">You do not perish.</span> You do not cease.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">You become one with the Rift itself.</span></p>

            <p>Absorbed into the endless cycle of existence and oblivion, your consciousness, your choices, and your very identity are scattered into the fabric of what has always been. The world may move on, but you are now part of something beyond time, beyond understanding.</p>

            <p>No one will remember you.</p>

            <p><span class="rift-energy">But the Rift always will.</span></p>

            <li>The <span class="rift-energy">Rift</span> was never a force to be fought or controlled. <span class="rift-energy">It was always waiting for something to complete it.</span></li>
            <li>By demanding the truth, you gave up your individual existence. <strong>You are not lost, but you are no longer you.</strong></li>
            <li>Unlike the Transcendence Ending, where you step beyond, this ending <strong>erases your identity into the Rift’s endless hum.</strong></li>
            <li>It is <strong>not death, not survival, but something entirely different.</strong></li>
