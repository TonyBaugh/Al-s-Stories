    <div class="content">
        <div class="title">=== Introduction ===</div>

        <p>A deep, unshakable cold clings to your skin as you awaken on the ground, the texture beneath you neither grass nor stone, but something <span class="fade">unplaceable</span>—smooth and shifting, like frozen silk. Your breath fogs in the dim air.</p>

        <p>Above you, the sky is <span class="warning">wrong.</span> A swirling <span class="rift">Rift</span>, an enormous tear in reality itself, pulses with hues you have no name for—<span class="blue-text">blues that burn</span>, <span class="rift">violets that shimmer</span>, <span class="highlight">gold that flickers like dying embers.</span></p>

        <p>It warps the horizon, distorting the landscape into impossibilities—trees bending into endless spirals, rivers that flow upward, distant mountains flickering between jagged peaks and rolling dunes.</p>

        <p>Your pulse pounds in your ears. <span class="fade">How did you get here?</span> Your mind is a hollow void where memories should be.</p>

        <p>A sound—a distant, echoing voice—cuts through the eerie silence. Footsteps crunch against the strange surface, hesitant but purposeful. A group approaches, their eyes filled with recognition, apprehension... and something else. <span class="warning">Reverence?</span> <span class="fade">Fear?</span></p>

        <p>One among them steps forward, his voice sharp with conviction.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"It's you. Finally, you've returned. But which side are you on this time?"</p>

        <p>The others murmur, conflicting whispers laced with awe and dread. A woman grips the hilt of a blade at her side, knuckles white. A faint <span class="rift">violet glow</span> dances across her fingers, a power barely restrained. She exhales sharply.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You don’t remember, do you?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"What you are? What you've done?"</p>

        <p>The air crackles as the <span class="rift">Rift</span> pulses again. A wave of nausea washes over you, disorienting and violent, as if reality itself is shifting beneath you.</p>

        <p>For a moment—just a moment—you see something else. <span class="highlight">Flashes of crimson fire, a city crumbling, hands reaching toward you, pleading.</span></p>

        <p>And then—<span class="fade">nothing.</span></p>

        <p>The world holds its breath, waiting.</p>

        <p>You feel it—the weight of a past you cannot recall pressing against you, <span class="rift">demanding a choice.</span></p>
