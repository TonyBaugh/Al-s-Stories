        <div class="title">=== 1st Major Decision: Who Are You? ===</div>

        <p>You feel the pressure of expectation from all around you. The faces watching you are filled with anticipation, terror, and something else - something <span class="fade">unreadable.</span> It is as though they already know what you will say, what you will choose, before the words even leave your lips.</p>  

        <p>But you don't know. <span class="fade">Not yet.</span></p>  

        <p>A single decision could define everything. Or perhaps it will reveal <span class="warning">nothing at all.</span></p>  

        <p>You cautiously nod, unsure of what else to do. The moment your head moves, the group erupts into chaos. Some cheer as if their savior has returned, others take a defensive stance as though you have confirmed their worst fears.</p>  

        <p>A man, clad in war-torn armor, steps forward, his expression an unsettling mix of relief and guilt.</p>  

        <p class="dialogue">"I knew it," he breathes. "You were always meant to lead us again."</p>  

        <p>But another voice cuts through the noise - a woman with sharp eyes and a dagger drawn.</p>  

        <p class="dialogue">"No. This is wrong. Last time, you nearly destroyed us all."</p>  

        <p>The world seems to tilt as two opposing realities press in on you. Were you a savior? A destroyer? Or neither?</p>  

        <p>The <span class="rift">Rift</span> hums behind you, pulsing as though it, too, is waiting for an answer.</p>
